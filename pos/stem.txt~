not

look
at
the

but
becaus
of
a
power
,
charismat
perform
from
edward

.
it
's
hard
to
believ
that
it
ha

fantast
role
in

fear
,
but
,
here
he
is
now
,
star
in
hi

film
and
make
himself
a
star
.
norton
is
on
of
those
perform
who
becom
hi
charact
,
and
hi
work
in
american
histori

is
on
of
the
veri
best
perform
thi
year

he
plai
a
young
man
name
derek

a

live
in

,

(

,
and
sister
,
davin
(

.
the
film
open
with
a
flashback
,
in
which
derek
brutal
kill
two
black
men
vandal
hi
car
.
we
find
out
that
thi
land
him
in
prison
,
and
the
film
from
that
point
is
seen
through
the
ey
of
danni
.
in
the
present-time
of
the
film
,
danni
is
in
high
school
,
and
eager
to
follow
the
footstep
of
hi
brother
.
much
of
the
film
is
told
in
flashback
,
and
we
see
the
path
that
lead
to
derek
's
adopt
of
white
supremaci
.
when
derek
is
releas
,
have
serv
three
year
in
prison
,
he
find
that
hi
brother
is
now
a
full-blown
skinhead
;
derek
,
howev
,
ha
given
up
the
violenc
,
and
tri
to
get
hi
brother
to
understand
why
racism
and
the
violenc
that
come
with
it
ar
bad
thing
.
what
make
thi
all
interest
is
that
these
two
young
men
ar
not
stupid
,
thoughtless
peopl
--
thei
ar
intellig
and
articul
,
and
voic
their

it
's
hard
to
make
a
controversi

and
not
preach
,
but
kay
ha
found
the
right
note
for
hi
materi
.
becaus
american

there
ha
to
be
a

it

that

that

it

the

aniston

also
surprisingli
good
as
the

(
and
the

sweet
)
,
but
she
did
n't
pull
me
in

enough
dure

i
wa
also
impress
by
some
of
the

plai
in

,
but

made
the
biggest
impress
among

it
's
to
note
that
thi

wa
base
on
a
real-life
tale
of
a
young

us
to

just

you

the

from
the

the

begin
with

declar
that
he

from
thi
point
we
know
capon
is

suppos
to
be
hi
big
``

role
from
zani
humor
into
darker
,
more
dramat
act
.
as
most
everyon
know
,
the
result
were
,
well
,
less-than-stellar
.
not
onli
did
the

not

hot

it

also
pan
by

as
far
as
i
know
,
gene
siskel
and
i
ar
the
onli
on
will
to
admit
that
we
dug
it
.
the
first
time
i
saw
the
cabl
gui
,
in
theatr
,
i
wa
in
super
critic-mode
,
and
did
n't
realli
like
it
.
howev
,
due
to
the
fact
that
hbo
show
the
movi
everi
singl
dai
,
i
've
had
time
to
lean
back
,
relax
,
and
take
in
the
film
.
and
to
my
surpris
,
it
grew
on
me
.
the
plot
is
rather
simpl
:
broderick
plai
a
gui
name
steven
who
befriend
hi
cabl
gui
,
plai
by
carrei
,
then
is
stalk
by
him
when
steven
tri
to
break
off
the
relationship
.
see
,
steven
's
been
have
some
problem
with
hi
girlfriend
,
robin
(
lesli
mann
)
,
and
he
doe
n't
think
he
ha
ani
more
room
in
hi
life
for
a
new
friend
.
also
,
some
of

antic
have
been
creep

out

carrei
,
as
the
cabl
gui
,
give
steven
variou
alias
,
which
later
we
find
out
ar
all
tv
charact
:
larri
tate
,
chip
dougla
,
ricki
ricardo
,
etc
.
he
appar
live
in
hi
cabl
van
,
and
while
mani
critic
did
n't
enjoi
thi
newer
,
darker
,
less-manic
perform
from
carrei
,
i
thought
it
wa
interest
and
rather
well-done
.
for
me
,
it
not
the
movi
as
a
whole
that
's
enjoy
,
but
rather
sever
individu
scene
:
a
karaok
jam
at
steven
's
apart
,
a
mediev
fight
at
a
theme
restaur
,
and
a
bathroom
beat
(
a
la
liar
,
liar
)
,
just
to
name
a
few
.
perhap
the
fact
that
more
of
carrei
's
humor
side
come
out
dure
these
scene
is
what
make
them
so
funni
.
and
if
you
realli
want
to
see
someth
,
you
've
got
to
hear
hi
version
of
jefferson
airplan
's
``
somebodi
to
love
``
,
sung
at
the
aforment
karaok
jam
.
the
cabl
gui
ha
it
bad
spot
,
like
most
ani
movi
.
i
did
n't
particularli
like
steven
's
girlfriend
,
and
i
felt
that
more
focu
should
have
been
us
on
the
relationship
between
steven
and
hi
best
friend
.
also
,
the
end
,
while
have
you
fool
for
a
moment
,
is
rather
contriv
,
and
somewhat
dissapoint
.
still
,
i
found
the
cabl
gui
to
be
a
worthwhil
ventur
;
if
you
're
at
the
video
store
and
ca
n't
think
of
anyth
to
rent
,
i
suggest
you
try
it
out
.
or
if
you
have
hbo
,
just
wait
till
it
come
on
(
you
wo
n't
have
to

,
that
's
what
i
do
everi

when

i
allow
myself
a

:

it

at

run
by
the
rich

although
the
anti-rich
sentiment
do
get
a
bit
tiresom
by

end
of

)
.
?
some
of
the
segment
ar
simpli
hilari
,
such
as
a
lengthi
rap
that
he
deliv
at

dedic
to
him

?
much
of
the

is
complet
absurd
,

that
's
the
fun
part
about
it
.
?
it
's
an
angri

seriou

at

,
but
the
packag
that

ha
creat
is
so
much
more
access
than

?
what
add
to
thi
feel
is

thi
is

on
of
the
best
thing
about

is
that
thei
can
make

analyz
thing
in

everydai
life
that
you
might
not
have
thought
much
of

.
with
some
film
it
might
be
just
a
secondari
issu
,
but
with
`dark

'
what
we
get
is
nearli
an
entir
film
commit
to
philosoph
and
theoriz
about
human
memori

how
it
defin
who
we
ar
,
which
is
a
poignant
theme
made
through
an
absolut
beautifulli-construct

that

happen

he
is

how
he

possibl

figur
that
out

along
the
wai
overcom
a
conflict

the
premis
to
thi

is
not
unlik
that

onli
thi
time
we
do

over
the

we
begin

is

neo-gothic
look

)
,
but
is
so
fulli
develop
it
's
almost
a

.
later
he
will
learn
that
hi

,
but
for
now
he
ha
no
idea
what
's
go
on
other
than
the
fact
someth
is
not
right
.
the
fact
there
's

but
with

there
is

to
be
some

that
simpli
doe

a
few
particular
which
did
n't
strike
my
fanci
includ
the
bulimia
and
``

``
sequenc
with
christin

,
the
break-danc

,
and
i
also
never
get
why
thei
us
real

like
thi
(
why
not
just
``
make
up
``
a

,
instead
of
zero
in
on
a
certain
peopl
?
)
.
i
also
could
have
done
with
less
of
the
taylor
charact
in
gener
,
sinc
she
wa
n't
all
that
interest
and
seem
to
slow
thing
down
everi
now
and
then
(

.
but
those
few
misstep
were
noth
compar
to
some
of
the
more
memor
scene
which
definit
did
work
for
me
!
i
almost
piss
myself

again

it
's
to

my

that

if
i

to
sai
anyth
bad
about

is
that
it
walk
the
line
between
drama
and
melodrama
.
it
's
too
sentiment
and
uplifit
for
a
straight
drama
,
but
the
emot
ar
too
subtl
for
melodrama
.
it
is
emotion
engag
,
but
it
's
not
quit
larger
than
life
.
thi
is
n't
a
problem
per
se
,
but
at
time
i
did
n't
know
quit
how
to
take
it
.
but
thi
is
a
rel
small
complaint
about
a
veri
good
movi
.
a
good
movi
allow
it
charact
to
learn
and
grow
.
it
doe
n't
just
happen
;
it
take
a
good
script
,
good
act
,
and
good
direct
.
good
will
hunt
ha
all
three
.
if
you
ar
at
all
inclin
to
see
it
,
by
all
mean
,
go
.
if
there
's
on
thing
in
common
about
all
of
hollywood
's
major
studio
,
it
's
that
their
product
ar
move
toward
mainstream
more
and

although

have
spawn
subsidiari
which
special

,
it
's
obviou
there
's
no
signific
movement
underwai
to
promot
invent

at
the
theater
.
so
when
a
movi
like
gari
ross

come
along
,
wrap
in
a
blanket
of
innov
idea
and
serv
up
on

it
's
a

although

pleasantvil

not

quit

the

i

that
while
be
a
comedi
,
the
film
also
had
an
intellig

too

subscrib

the

that

make

watch

,
laugh
a

,
leav
the

take
noth

matine
is
not
like
that
.
i
left
the
pictur
think
about
what
i
would
do
face
with
the
cuban
missil
crisi
.
i
found
myself
wonder
what
would
happen
to
the
charact
of
the
film
.
but
most
importantli
,
i
found
myself
care
about
what
would
happen
to
the
charact
.
the
comedi
of
the
film
center
around
goodman
,
hi
charact
,
and
the
film
he
bring
to
kei
west
.
i
believ
that
goodman
is
on
of
the
finest
comed
actor
in
the
busi
todai
.
he
is
highli
express
both
physic
and
vocal
.
i
felt
he
at
least
deserv
an
oscar
nomin
for
hi
work
in
barton
fink
.
the
other
charact
ar
often
lost
in
a
scene
with
him
due
to
hi
command
natur
,
howev
,
while
the
star
,
goodman
is
actual
not
at
the
center
of
the
film
.
the
movi
is
realli
the
stori
of
the
four
teenag
,
discov
who
thei
ar
and
what
thei
want
,
against
a
background
where
at
ani
minut
it
could
all
end
.
i
thought
the
kid
reaction
were
highli
realist
.
thei
tri
to
block
it
out
,
thei
tri
to
escap
from
the
concern
of
their
world
.
unfortun
it
kept
creep
back
in
,
particularli
with
the
fear
,
and
the
chao
of
the
time
.
while
the
comedi
center
on
goodman
,
and
the
drama
on
the
teen
,
there
wa
a
great
deal
of
overlap
.
sever
aspect
of
the
panic
ar
shown
in
a
humor
light
.
on
exampl
is
a
scene
where
peopl
ar
fight
each
other
for
the
the
last
can
and
box
of
food
in
a
groceri
store
.
if
you
think
about
it
the
threat
of
nuclear
annihil
seem
hardli
to
be
the
backdrop
for
a
comedi
,
but
it
work
here
.
anoth
reason
i
like
thi
film
is
that
i
like
b-
scienc
fiction
movi
.
on
of
my
favorit
film
to
go
watch
is

(
note
i

not

mant

serv
mostli

so
again
i
would
like
to
recommend
matine
to
anybodi
look
for
a
good

humor
stori
.
thi
is
n't
a
gag
film
like
mani

but
an
intellig

well-thought
out

film
about
real
peopl
with

when

the

when

have

we
have

that
it

where
peopl
stood
outsid
to

see
a
then-technolog
achiev
,
even
though
it
wa
from
the
russian
?
it
sound
hokei
,
but
when
that
scene
occur
near
the
begin
of
_octob

,
i
found
myself
caught
up
with
the
enthusiasm
of
homer
hickam
,
plai
by
jake
gyllenha
.
determin
to
make
a
dent
in
the
space
race
,
he
becom
transfix
with
hi
desir
to
make
a
rocket
that
could
fly
like
the
best
of
them
.
it
is
film
like
thi
that
we
know
the
end
as
we
bui
the
ticket
.
when

that

enter

find
into
the
nation
scienc
fair
,
we
know
exactli
who
is
go
to
win
.
but
the
joi
in
a
film
like
thi
is
in
the
littl
detail
.
for
exampl
,
homer
is
clearli
not
the
strongest
student
in
hi
class
.
if
he
ha
ani
strength
whatsoev
,
it
is
an
undet
vision
,
and
a
good
organ
.
it
mean
that
he
mai
have
to
lose
hi
reput
by
associ
with
the
nerdiest
kid
in
school
,
who
know
more
about
rocket
scienc
than
he
doe
.
it
mean
that
if
hi
father
forbid
him
to
shoot
rocket
on
compani
properti
(
that
is
,
the
entir
coal-mine
town
)
,
he
must
walk
eight
mile
on
wai
,
just
to
set
up
the
rocket
,
which
will
fail
,
fail
,
fail

and
fail
again

homer+s

here
he
plai
the
antithesi
of

plai
in

:
instead
of

ralli
,
he
is
the
head
of
the
coal-miner
,
who
is
constantli
wring
hi

against

.
thi
is
will
be
on
of
the
great
unnot
perform
of
the

:
note
how
multi-dimension
hi
charact
is
.
he
is
hi
son+s

,
as
on
who
most
like
interfer

.
but
he
truli
love
hi

,
and
want
to
see
him
succe
the
onli
wai
he
know
how
.
through

.
becaus
of
hi
charact
,
we
can
see
how
far
we+ve
come
.
the

for

to
see

we
don+t

that
there
were

a

the
paradigm
wa
shift
under
the
father+s
feet
,
and
he
knew
of
no

.
so
_octob

,
far
from
be
mere
a
feel-good

,
offer
much
food
for

and
thi
is
the
best

the

our

we

actual
we

but
i
sat

wonder
where
all
the

yeah
there
were
some
in

not

.
the

now
for

it

explos
,
and
save
the

some
of
the

were

the

the

and
all

the

the

rife
with
imag

a

a

easi
to

the

give
him
a

the

it

the

gibson

i

he
provid
a
fantast
perform

the
preview
of
thi

led
me
to
believ
it
wa
an
all-out
action
flick
,
which
after
view
,
it
wa
almost
the
opposit
in
a
certain
sens
.
gibson

charact
ha
an
almost
uncount
number
of
on-liner
,
hilari
situat

and
hi
charact
is
on
that
the
audienc
tend
to
side

for
instanc
,
jerri
's
apart
(
and
especi
hi
secur
)
is
memor
.
and
last
,
i
wa
surpris
at
how
good
the
plot
is
.
writer
brian
helgeland
ha
creat
a
terrif
stori
,
and
when
watch
thi
film
,
you
ar
left
to
wonder
if
all
of
jerri
fletcher
's
far-fetch
(
or
so
thei
seem
at
first
)
conspiraci
theori
ar
helgeland
's
own
opinion
.
mel
gibson
is
n't
the
onli
stand-out
in
the
film
.
julia

is
veri
good
in
her

the

ca
n't

who
continu

that
she
will
do
someth
about

he
also
seem
obsess
and
in

with

but
whenev
he
approach
her
with
anoth

,
she
shrug
him
and
hi

continu
note
that
on

jerri
,
obvious
determin
to
continu

,
continu
to

inform
for

next
conspiraci

,
which
will
be

.
although
he
onli

subscrib

he
put
a
larg
amount
of
time
and
effort
into
hi
work
,
and
publish
hi
next

.
veri
soon
after
he
doe
so
,
he
is
abduct
and
tortur
by
a
sinist
man
who
refer
to
himself
as

jona
(

after

escap
aliv
,
jerri
is
forc
to
turn
to
the
onli
person
he
can
trust

the

creat

fascin
from

take

,
the

he
's
an
almost
exaggeratedli
twist
,
emotion
unstabl
man
outsid
of
hi
profess
is
not
at
all
difficult
to
believ

pullman
's
perform
is
much
more
layer
than
it
might
seem
at
first
glanc
,
and
the
occasion
voic-over
as
he
's
go
through
the
motion
of
hi

ar
insight
and
often
hilari
.
ben
stiller
is
also
a

he
's
the

of

dialogu-driven
(

it
's
the

that
's
funni

's
on

it

give

let

:
it
's
a

there

watch

the

it

for

although
,
at

the

ar
good

is
the
basic

stori

but
at
time
,
thing
seem
to
get
a

muddl

the

appear
to
want
to
do
too
mani
thing
at
onc

that
realli
doe
n't
take
awai
from
the
stori
too
much
,
but
it
doe
hurt
it
a
littl
bit
.
blade
(
snipe
)
is
half
man
,
half
vampir
.
hi
mother
wa
bitten
by
a
vampir
when
she
wa
pregnant
with
him
and
as
a
result
he
ha
mani
of
the
classic
trait
of
a
vampir
.
includ
a
thirst
for
human
blood
that
must
be
kept
under
control
by
a
special
serum
which
quench
hi
blood
lust
.
blade
ha
spent
hi
life
hunt
down
and
kill
vampir
as
a
sort
of
reveng
for
the
fact
that
on
of
their
kind
kill
hi
mother
.
but
thi
is
n't
as
easi
as
it
seem
,
becaus
the
vampir
in
blade
's
world
ar
more
sophist
than
the
on
that
you
find
in
most
film
.
the
govern
and
other
author
know
of
the
exist

thei
let

feast

in

thei

i
person
thought
that
thi
whole

to
be
a
veri
clever
idea

and
a
great
addit
to
the
movi

blade
run
up
against
the
evil
deacon
frost
(
stephen
dorff
)
a
maverick
in
the
vampir
commun
.
he
is
n't
content
to
live
among
human
,
and
is
convinc
that
the
vampir
race
is
the
superior
on
and
he

it

he
ha
manag

of
the
method
of
make
him

it
's
up
to
blade
to
see
that
thi
doe
n't

.
admittedli
,
blade
is
style
over
substanc
through
and
through
.
the
stori
is
a
rel
forgett
on
,
but
it
is
fun
none
the
less
.
the
act
in
blade
is
just
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
movi
of
thi
type
.
thi
is
n't
a

the

it

blade
's

ar
as
slick
as

that
you
will
find
in

the
combat

ar
incred
well
done

although
,
the
mtv-style

did

homer
feel

silent
struggl

a
welcom
chang
to
the
dramat
genr
,
and
on
that
everyon
should
see
.
a
big
surpris
to
me
.
the
good
trailer
had
hint
that
thei
pull
the
imposs
off
,
but
make
a
blue
brother
movi
without
jake
blue
(
john
belushi
)
is
such
a
dumb
idea
i
realli
had
no
hope
.
thei
replac
him
just
fine
.
not
with
john
goodman
,
he
did
n't
do
much
of
anyth
,
but
with
the
brilliant
actor
joe
morton
,
who
can
realli
sing
.
the
fourth
blue
brother
is
j
evan
bonif
,
who
's
ten
.
thi
wa
anoth
of
my
fear
for
the
film
,
but
he
's
a
realli
good
dancer
,
and
plai
a
mean
harmonica
(
although
he
mai
have
been
dub
)
.
thing
that
intellectu
had
bother
me
befor
,
like
no
mission
from
god
,
everyon
be
richer
,
it
not
be
film
in
chicago
--
gave
me
no
problem
at
all
.
i
'm
quit
pleas
that
there
were
less
car
pile-up
,
becaus
thei
meant
less
music
,
and
john
landi
seem
to
have
lost
interest
in
the
whole
thing
.
there
's
a
few
earli
crash
,
and
then
on
huge
pile-up
,
but
after
that
it
all
stop
.
it
's
just
the
music
.
on
of
my
problem
with
the
first
is
that
cab
callowai
's
song
is
so
good
the
actual
blue
brother
look
dull
after
him
,
but
there
's
no
problem
with
thi
.
the
music
is
all
as
good
as
ever
,
ton
of
great
musician
show
up
--
with
the
except
of
johnni
lang
,
who
ca
n't
sing
,
all
the
musician
do
a
great
job
.
the
onli
real
problem
i
had
wa
the
special
effect
.
these
were
superflu
and
a
wast
of
monei
.
sinc
the
film
is
n't
do
veri
well
,
thei
could
mean
we
have
no
possibl
of
anoth
sequel
,
which
i
want
to
see
.
the
bluegrass
version
of
rider
in
the
sky
is
even
better
than
rawhid

see
that
all
of
the
senior
girl
ar
smitten
with
the
handsom
guidanc
counselor
,
but
none
more
than
kelli
.
throughout
the
first
portion
of
the

we
see
how

kelli
will
go
to
get

until
she
accus
him

that
the

start
to
reveal
just
who
is
be
honest
with
each

and
who
ha
their

matt
dillon
star

the
kind

the
previou
two
``

film
have
each
had
their
own
uniqu
style
to
them
.
the
ridlei
scott

wa
veri
much
a
stylist
suspens
film
.
jame
cameron
's
alien
wa
much
more
of
an
action
film
.
and
i
like
each
film
separ
for
which
it
wa
.
now
alien
3
is
out
.
and
it
is
it
's
own
film
in
the
same
right
that
alien
and
alien
were
.
unlik
alien
,
alien
3
requir
that
you
have
seen
alien
.
thi
is
veri
import
as
the
stori
pick
up
exactli
were
alien
left
off
.
the
survivor
of
the
expedit
to
lv-426
ar
return
home
after
battl
and
beat
the
alien
.
the
climact
fight
scene
between
riplei
and
the
mother
alien
on
the
sulaco
in
alien
left
behind
on
item
,
an
egg
.
in
the
open
sequenc
we
see
the
egg
hatch
,
find
it
quarri
,
which
lead
to
a
fire
aboard
the
sulaco
when
the
facehugg
is
injur
,
an
lead
the
sulaco
to
jettison
the
hypersleep
tube
in
an
escap
vessel
.
thi
vessel
crash
land
on
furi
109
.
everyon
in
the
vessel
is
kill
,
except
riplei
.
the
facehugg
is
jettison
with
them
and
surviv
the
crash
.
furi
109
is
an
ex-mine/maximum
secur
prison
.
when
close
down
,
some
of
the
lifer
prison
decid
to
stai
and
live
out
the
remain
year
on
the
planet
.
all
the
prison
ar
men
who
have
not
seen
a
woman
in
mani
year
.
riplei
's
arriv
spark
a
problem
with
the
inmat
.
as
for
the
new
haircut
that
riplei
and
the
prison
's
sport
,
there
is
an
infest
of
lice
on
the
planet
.
be
an
ex-prison
mean
that
there
is
no
wai
off
the
planet
and
no
weapon
.
so
the
prison
and
riplei
ar
off
to
face
the
alien
on
their
own
.
i
will
not
go
into
detail
,
but
you
can
guess
what
happen
here
.
the
alien
is
loos
and
no
on
believ
riplei
's
outstand
stori
.
she
find
comfort
in
the
arm
of
the
coloni
's
doctor
.
ye
,
after
57
year
riplei
ha
sex
.
it
is
not
gratuit
,
in
fact
,
we
do
n't
even
see
them
kiss
,
but
it
is
just
as
well
.
a
sweati
sex
scene
would
not
have
work
in
the
context
of
the
film
.
there
is
a
lot
more
gore
in
alien
3
.
in
fact
i
would
guess
to
sai
that
there
is
more
in
alien
3
than
either
of
the
earlier
two
.
it
also
sport
a
new
alien
with
4
leg
!
i
wo
n't
sai
how
,
but
it
lead
us
to
believ
a
few
new
thing
about
the
alien
and
it
cycl
,
which
i
am
sure
will
be
explor
in
alien
4
.

lend
itself
to
the
claustrophob
set
that
the
``

seri
been
set
in

thi
time
the
score
is
not
so
much
a
rip
off
of
star

ii
(
jame
horner
's

.
thi
score
ha
a
choral
back
up
at

and
even
lend
itself
to
the
old
style
of
ennio
morricon

.
thi
is
a
great
score
.
the
end
to

is
quit
good

there
were
time
i

that
hollywood
would

i
will
not
ruin
the
end
for
you

go
see

i
consid
it
to
be
a
much
more
involv
film
than

of
the

releas
so
far
thi

alien

thi

the
``

could

must
sai

besid
the
near
end
,
the
onli
other
critic
of
the

which
i
have
is
that
the
movi
is
almost
too
cerebr

i
almost
left
with
the
sens
littl
happen

almost
all
the
chang
which
occur

happen
in
deep
in

littl
in

the
situat

thei
end
as
part
of
.
the
on
question
which
i
am
left
with
is
while
thei
have
accept
their

,
ha
their
attitud

chang
?
i
have
sever
possibl
which
i
believ
the
movi
hint
at
,
but
i
am
unsur
of
which
the
director
is
espous
.
in
summari
,
thi
movi
is
sole
about
the
charact
growth
of
two
charact
who
almost
develop
a
relationship
.
in
the
process
,
we
see
their
attitud
toward
life
and
other
peopl
.
in
itself
,
i
do
not
believ
un
coeur
is
a
complic
movi
.
where
it
doe
becom
complic
is
when
we
juxtapos
the
scene
of
the
movi
into
the
greater
walk
of
life
where
we
,
as
american
,
have
preconceiv
american
notion
of

love

i
do
wonder
how
the

also

easili
rise
to
the
challeng

there
's
also
(
thankfulli
)
a
bit
of
chemistri
between
them
.
kinnear
,
as
the
gai
neighbor
,
seem
to
have
a
slightli
underwritten
role
,
he
's
more
of
a

although
hi
perform
is
good

hi
charact
just
seem
to
exist
to
help
melvin

carol
come
togeth

in
fact

the
scene
stealer
is
simon

then
again

although

,
he
is
still
fun

he
overact
a
littl

but
not
so
much
as
to
be
annoi

smith
is
also
good

although

.
even
director
lawrenc
kasdan
(
bodi

make

but
thi
is

nicholson

and
everi

he
's

he

though
,
it
's
amaz
that
anyon
talk

at
all

especi

and
thi
is
the

main

it

unbeliev

,
the

forc

also
,
melvin
charact
seem
to
go
too
nice
,
too
quickli

i
would
doubt
anyon
with
a
charact
like
melvin
would
be
abl
to
turn
back
to
a
nice
,
love
person
.
it
would
take
a
helluva
long
time
,
much
longer
than
thi
film
would
like
to
make
out
.
brook
direct
is
good
,
though
,
if
a
bit
averag
,
but
he
usual
manag
to
get
an
emot
out
of
the
audienc
.
he
handl
the
comedi
scene
better
than
the
sentiment
on
(
he
tend
to
pile
on
to
much
schmaltz
)
but
gener
he
's
good
.
there
's
also
a
nice
soundtrack
by
veteran

han
zimmer

but
,
gener
,
as
good
as
it
get
achiev
what
it
set
out
to
do
,
which
is
to
make
the
audienc
feel
good
by
the
end
of
the
movi
.
the
movi
is
a
bit
overlong
,

is
such
good
fun
that
the

overal

not

rudolph

pleasant

it

to

there
ar
sever
reason

thi
,

the
paramount
on
is
that
rudolph
seem
to
have
mute
some
of
the
most
strident

manner

the
charact
here
ar
more
like

the
stori
is
absorb

the

the

perhap
the
best
moment
is
when
he
sing

the

tenebra
is
perhap
the
most
multi-layer
of
argento
's
script
to
date
and
there
is
much
bubbl
underneath
the

here
.
it
mai
take
at

two

in

thei
ar

fact
that

rather

the
dark

instead

ha

to

no

it

not

it

who
do
n't
stop
till
thei

thi

's

on

the

,
most
of
them
do
their

succe
well
in
pass
the
torch
onto
the
next
victim
.
but
the
true
glue
that
hold
thi
film
togeth
,
other
than
the
spirit
of
elvi
himself
,
is
costner
and
russel
,
who
plai
their

charact

sure
,
russel
's
been
down
thi

befor
,
but
costner
surpris
me
with
hi
nasti
.
i
guess
he
's
piss
at
all
the
box-offic

that
he
's
been
in

he
sure
plai
a

here

in

end
,
the
bottom
line
with
thi

is

make
sure
there
's

around

and

there
is
also
thi
on
realli
great
show-down
scene
between

and
a
cop
,
that
'll
have
you
crackin
'
up
and
lovin
'
it
all
at
the

.
the
violent
scene
in
thi
movi
ar
violent
and
the
entir
film
is
wrap
in
a
soundtrack
that
'll
kick
your
ars
from
thi
end
of
the
theatr
to
the
next

it
should
actual
come
to
no
surpris
to
anyon
that
the
director
of
thi
movi
come
from
a
music
video
background
,
with
plenti
,
and
i
mean
plenti
,
of
camera
trick
,
cut
and
edit
,
but
for
thi
kind
of
flick
,
it
actual
work
.
the
film
is
not
perfect
though
,
it
start
off
with
a
pretti
big
bang
,
but
then
pull
a
wai
of
the
gun
on
us
,
and
slow
the
pace
down
somewhat
in
the
middl
,
while
charact
intermingl

dispers

i
wa
person
kept
in

despit

enjoi

did

no

okai
,
well
i
just
did
!
i
coulda
done
without
her
whole
``
romanc
``
angl
,
but
to
be
honest
,
it
doe
n't
take
up
much
of
the
film
,
which
is
gener
cover
in

,
explos

try
to
see
how

of

it
's
no

so
pleas
take
thi
whole

with

in

i
also
like
these
type
of
``

movi
a
lot
,
and
even
though
the
film
doe
n't
bring
much
origin
to
the

it
doe
offer
a
pretti
coher
stori

some
nice

,
humor
and
a
big
ol
'
help
of
whoop-ass
come
straight
from
costner
and
russel

probabl
not
a

who
enjoi

in

thi

less

with

had
go

quit
a
few
of
the

have
read
led
me
to
believ
that
thi

wa
absolut
hilari
and
would
make
me
laugh
out
loud
the
whole
wai
through
,
and
it
did
n't
do
that
.
thei
also
led
me
to
believ
that
it
would
deliv
a
viciou
and
all-too-true
attack

it
did
n't

do

a

the

the

soon
find

thei
do

dure
thi

break
up
in

show
how
pop

ha
plai
a
major
role
in

)
.
the
plot
in
three
word
is
:
women
and
music

the
approach
director
stephen
frear
take
by
have
the
charismat

it
give

adject
which
perfectli
parallel
rob

lifestyl
.
it
also
help
open
the
viewer
's
ey
as
to
how
annoi
barri
is
.
jack
black
steal
the
show
with
a
hilari
realist
perform
as
a
total
sleaz
ball
.
just
listen
to
him
speak
for
five
minut
make
the
audienc
immedi
sympathet
for
rob
,
who
must
work
with
him
everi
dai
of
the

.
what
frear
doe
so
well
is
that
he
make
us
feel
sorri
for
rob
while
laugh
at
hi
misfortun
.
john
cusack
plai
hi
charact
convincingli
but
it
is
the
strong
support
cast
,
consist
of
big
star
and
charact
actor
,
that
realli
defin
rob
.
now
instead
of

just
talk
to
the

,
after
he
explain
someth
,
the
remain
cast
member
physic
and
humor
creat
what
he
is

the
onli
problem
with
high
fidel
is
that
it
doe
n't
end
when
it
should
have
end
.
instead
the
movi
goe
on
for
a
tortur
twenti

that
seem
a

longer
than

.
also
bruce
springsteen
is
complet
wast
in

high
fidel
is
a
cheer
,
old
fashion
comedi
with
a

and
as

i
just
hope
hollywood

oh

did

critiqu
:
despit
thi
film
not
look
like
a
``
tim
burton
movi
``
or
it
lead
human
charact
show
ani
sign
of
be
a
human
be
himself
,
i
did
find
myself
gener
entertain
throughout
most
of
thi
film
and
do
recommend
it
as
fun
,
summer
fare
.
although
the
thing
that
set
thi
movi
apart
from
all
other
is
definit
it
incred
ap
make-up
job
and
character
.
i
mean
,
i
wa
complet
convinc
that
everi
singl
on
of
these
ap
wa
for
real
!
i
also
have
to
``
give
it
up
``
to
all
of
the
actor
insid
the
costum
,
not
onli
for
wake
up
at
three
in
the
morn
everi
dai
to
get
make-up
slobber
all
over
them
for
2-4
hour
,
but
for
come
through
their
costum
exterior
and
sell
us
their
charact
on
the
screen
as
well
.
i
especi
enjoi
bonham
carter
's
perform
,
who
i
believ
to
be
the
most
develop
charact
in
the
entir
film
(
human
or
ap
)
and
tim
roth
's
bad
gui
,
who
chew
up
sceneri
and
ooz
evil
in
everi
scene
in
which
he
took
part
.
plot-wise
,
i
like
the
begin
of
the
film
,
the
whole
build-up
onc
wahlberg
got
into
the
villag
,
the
escap
and
most
of
the
fight
scene
,
but
onc
thing
got
out
into
the
desert
area
(
and
the
final
battl
sequenc
)
,
i
kinda
lost
a
bit
of
my
interest
.
i
wa
much
more
intrigu
by
the
interact
between
the
charact
and
the
whole
idea
of
``
human
be
as
anim
``
then
i
wa
about
the
end
battl
sequenc
,
which
just
seem
a
bit
too
typic
for
thi
kind
of
film
.
i
also
hate
the
``
kid
``
charact
who
just
got
on
my
nerv
and
did
n't
realli
care
for
the
wai
that
the
battl
sequenc
wa
resolv
(
i
wo
n't
ruin
it
here
but
c'mon
gui
.
.
.
you
coulda
thought
of
someth
a
littl
more
plausibl
than
that
,
no
?
)
.
but
the
thing
that
held
thi
movi
back
more
than
anyth
els
wa
it
lead
charact
,
hi
cold
demeanor
and
the
zero
chemistri
that
he
share
with
either
on
of
hi
inter-speci
love
interest
.
thi
dude
did
n't
seem
to
give
a
rat
's
ass
about
anyon
but
himself
and
i
ultim
did
n't
realli
care
about
what
happen
to
him
either
.
now
i
'm
not
sure
if
thi
wa
the
fault
of
the
actor
or
the
script
,
but
the
film
suffer
becaus
of
it
.
visual
,
the
movi
wa
also
nice
to
look
at
(
especi
the
ap
!
)
,
but
i
definit
expect
greater
cool
from
tim
burton
.
the
``
surpris
end
``
that
highlight
the
origin
planet
of
the
ap
film
back
in
1968
,
felt
a
littl
tack
on
here
,
and
despit
be
interest
,
did
n't
realli
make
all
that
much
sens
to
me
(
unless
you
look
at
it
from
a
sequel
point
of
view
)
.
so
overal
,
i
love
the
whole
``
feel
``
of
the
planet
,
the
ap
that
rule
it
,
the
manner
in
which
thei
treat
the
human
,
scream
,
shout
and
revert
the
entir
evolut
chain
,
but
did
n't
appreci
the
film
's
lack
of
human
charact
develop
(
why
wa
kri
kristofferson
even
in
thi
movi
?
)
and
the
fact
that
it
lead
male
and
femal
human
were
just
plain
bore
.
but
i
would
still
recommend
thi
film
as
a
fun
,
summer
movi
with
laugh
,
creepi
and
a
realli
cool
premis
.
ps
:
for
anyon
who
ha
seen
the
origin
,
i
can
not
believ
that
thei
did
n't
at
least
bring
back

in

the

most

the
problem
with

is
that

the

no

the

to

up

weak

how

is
basic
an
unremark
,
if
affect

tale
of
love
across
the

a
sort
of
truncat
american
version
of
the
joi
luck
club
,
with
a
dash
of
fri

.
there
ar
probabl
too
mani
charact

so
,
instead
of
realli
get
to
know
a
few
of
them
,
we
ar
present
with
quick
glimps
into
a
singl
defin
event
in
each
of
their
live
.
we
learn
about
the
root
of
the
smolder
resent
between
gladi

hy
,
and
ar
told
the
reason
why
emma
stai
with

sophia
is
so
irasc

there
ar
other
episod
as
well
:
the
love
of

,
marianna

and
a
look
at
the
reason
why
constanc
enter

friend

the
sum
total
of
these
tale
is
meant
to
provid

framework
for
finn
's
stori
:
whether
to
go
forward
with
her
marriag
or
dalli
with
a
hunki
stranger
.
there
is
no
emot
epiphani
in
how
to
make
an
american
quilt
.
the
stori
ar
all
well-told
,
but
it
's
difficult
to
realli
connect
with
the
charact
--
their
moment
pass
so
quickli
.
while
we
certainli
feel
someth
for
each
of
the
eight
princip
,
our
emot
invest
is
tenuou
.
there
is
n't
enough
depth
to
pull
the
viewer
in
all
the
wai
,
and
mani
of
the
person
and
relationship
feel
half-
form
,
like
a
quilt
with
patch
miss
.
to
put
it
bluntli
,
while
i
enjoi
watch
thi
film
,
it
did
n't
``
do
much
``
for
me
.
on
the
whole
,
how
to
make
an
american
quilt
is
a
nice-underst
drama
that
ha
a
lot
to
sai
about
love
,
passion
,
and
monogami
in
relationship
.
finn
's
segment
is
by
far
the
most
compel

becaus
she
's
the
focal
point
:
her

the

of

ar
success

if
there
's
a
disappoint
here
,
it
's
that
the
script
doe
n't
have
more
reson
,
but
the
privileg
of
see
such
a
fine
cast
in
top
form
allow
a
viewer
to
enjoi
thi
pictur
even
if
the
stori

not

rushmor

is
so
perfect
in

that
it
come
as
a
shock
that

audit
some
two

star
befor

plai

activ
(
such
as
write
edgi
plai
like
``

and
be
presid
of
the
rushmor
beekeep
)
but
see
hi
grade
suffer
as
a
result
.
on
the
brink
of
be
thrown
out
,
he
land
himself
in

more
hot
water
when
he
fall
for

and
enlist
the

to
build
an

(
on

unfortun
for

blume
find
that

ha
feel
for
miss
cross
as
well
,
which
get
in
the
wai
of
max
's
plan
to
woo
her
.
max
is
on
of
the
best-written
charact
we
've
yet
seen
in
the
90s
,
and
schwartzman
plai
him
to
perfect
in
on
of
the
finest
comedi

ever
given
by
someon
of

.
as
everyon

ha
probabl

point
out
,
he
is
reminisc
of
a
young
dustin

(
although
i
wa
remind
more
of
paul

from
a

,
at

)
.
hopefulli
,
if
he
avoid
typecast
as
weird
,
quirki
loner-type
he
should
earn
himself
a
good

bill

he
is

here

much
to
do

still
doe

we
find

the
truth
about

past
end
up
to
a
sentiment
and
veri
heart-warm
end

on
thing
i
notic
about
the
film
instantli
wa
the
fantast
special

.
just
like
in

the

``
stuart

hi
famili
ar
all

and
thei
look
fantast
real
.
from
the
detail
of
their

to
the
detail
of
the
wai

;
the
special

team
put
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
on
thi
$
90
million

film
and
it
show
.
anoth
movi
that
thi
ha
in
common
with
is
``

``
with
it
's
talk
anim
and
peopl
understand
them
.
it
ha
a
famili
friendli
atmospher
and
is
never

scari
or

enough
to
even
scare

movi
doe

bring
more
out

he
to
me
fit

end
up
make

even
more
lovabl

anoth
gem
of
the
film
is
nathan

as
snowbal
.
when
he
wa
timon
in
1994
's
``
the
lion
king

i
would
have
sworn
he
wa
a
comedian
,
and
now
in
``
stuart
littl
``
he
bring
the
most
out
of
snowbal
and
make
him
on
of
those
charact
we
love
to
dislik

for
the
human
actor
geena
davi
who
never
give
a

perform
doe
not

here
as
well

she
fit
nice
in

there
is
a
good
chemistri
between
her
and
hugh

plai
mr

both
make
us
believ
thei

happili
in

jonathan
lipnicki
as
their

is
even
more
ador

.
even
though
stuart

is
complet

the
human

have
a
nice
chemistri
togeth

]
first
of
all
we
have
to
catalog
what
we
know
about
the
film
befor
even
go
into
it
.
we
know
that
young
anakin
skywalk
will
grow
up
to
becom
the
evil
ruler
darth
vader
who
is
also
the
father
of
luke
skywalk
,
who
will
lead
a
success
revolut
against
him
and
hi
empir
.
we
know
obi-wan
`ben
'
kenobi
wa
the
trainer
of
anakin
in
the
wai
of
`the
forc
'
in
attempt
to
becom
a
jedi
knight
,
but
would
fail
and
thu
anakin
would
fall
to
the
`dark
side
.
'
we
also
know
someth
about
`the
forc
'
itself
,
that
it
is
some
kind
of
univers
forc
which
determin
fate
and
can
be
manipul
by
those
whose
mind
ar
expand
enough
to
believ
in
it
and
feel
it
(
the
jedi
)
.
what
we
do
n't
know
for
sure
is
the
histori
of
the
rule
of
the
galaxi
,
which
is
most
like
much
longer
and
more
complex
than
ani
govern
we
have
had
here
on
earth
.
to
me
,
thi
wa
on
of
the
most
fascin
aspect
of
the
first
three
film
becaus
there
seem
to
be
a
subtl
,
definit
order
to
all
the
complex
.
also
,
it
seem
that
we
're
suppos
to
be
familiar
with
a
few
other
detail
about
the
stori
which
have
come
out
of
the
thousand
of
comic
book
and
paperback
publish
in
the
year
sinc
the
movi
end
.
most
notabl
,
detail
regard
the
emperor
from
`empir
'
and
`jedi
,
'
and
that
he
wa
onc
a
senat
and
hi
last
name
is
palpatin
.
for
those
who
have
n't
kept
up
with
all
the
`star
war
'
paraphernalia
over
the
year
,
there
is
still
a
wai
to
know
these
detail
simpli
by
recogn
an
actor
(
or
hi
voic
at
least
)
.
with
`the
phantom
menac
'
be
the
first
chapter
of
a
long
saga
,
on
would
assum
the
basic
groundwork
would
be
laid
,
includ
the
histori
behind
all
the
major
factor
of
the
seri
,
especi
`the
forc
'
and
the
jedi
knight
.
unfortun
,
thi
film
doe
more
of
the
opposit
as
it
simpli
build
on
top
of
what
must
be
a
histori
so
long
and
detail
it
could
never
be
explain
.
i
did
n't
like
that
aspect
to
thi
film
and
is
on
of
the
reason
it
fall
just
short
of
great
.
if
you
're
go
to
tell
a
stori
from
the
begin
-
tell
it
from
the
begin
(
is
it
possibl
that
after
thi
trilogi
is
complet
there
could
be
anoth
trilogi
of
episod
-1
through
-3
to
clarifi
the
back
stori
even
further
?
)
.
but
i
digress
.
i
've
said
so
much
and
yet
i
have
n't
even
touch
on
the
specif
of
the
film
itself
.
all
these
necessari
`disclaim
'
element
should
go
to
show
just
how
vast
the
stori
of
the
`star
war
'
seri
is
and
thi
individu
film
itself
.
what
we
get
here
is
a
movi
not
unlik
ani
of
the
other
three
we
've
come
to
know
and
love
sinc
the
late
1970s
.
it
similar
to
the
other
film
help
to
keep
the
spirit
of
the
seri
familiar
,
but
at
the
same
time
seem
to
be
a
flaw
in
the
filmmak
process
itself
sinc
it
sometim
ring
of
unorigin
.
the
basic
stori
is
rather
sort
,
complex
and
even
confus
at
time
.
we
're
told
that
an
armi
known
as
`the
trade
feder
'
ha
set
up
a
blockad
around
an
seemingli
insignific
planet
call
naboo
.
we
're
not
given
too
mani
detail
to
clarifi
the
back
stori
of
what
the
feder
is
and
what
their
purpos
is
,
instead
the
film
opt
to
get
it
stori
move
quickli
.
we
're
introduc
to
two
jedi
,
the
master
qui-gon
jinn
(
neeson
)
and
hi
apprentic
obi-wan
kenobi
(
mcgregor
)
.
the
two
ar
act
as
ambassador
of
some
sort
in
hope
of
end
the
obviou
hostil
between
the
feder
and
the
planet
's
queen
,
amidala
(
portman
)
.
the
leader
of
the
feder
,
an
alien
call
viceroi
,
is
follow
the
order
of
a
strang
,
mythic
charact
-
an
older
human
man
whose
face
and
bodi
ar
cover
and
shadow
by
the
black
robe
and
hood
he
wear
.
he
is
refer
to
as
lord
sidiou
but
consid
hi
appear
,
and
especi
that
creepi
evil
voic
of
hi
,
he
is
a
obvious
on
of
the
most
signific
charact
in
the
seri
.
sidiou
commun
to
viceroi
onli
through
digit
transmiss
and
never
in
person
.
clearli
hi
actual
whereabout
ar
someth
he
want
to
keep
secret
becaus
that
would
also
reveal
hi
ident
(
which
is
never
openli
reveal
in
the
film
,
but
should
be
clear
to
most
viewer
.
i
have
a
feel
we
'll
delv
into
hi
background
in
the
next
two
film
)
.
but
it
doe
n't
take
the
film
long
to
spring
into
action
and
within
minut
our
hero
jedi
ar
fight
for
their
live
and
the
film
's
stori
begin
to
move
along
.
the
film
doe
n't
have
on
specif
plot
and
work
in
the
same
manner
as
the
other
film
in
the
seri
where
as
what
we
get
is
on
mini-plot
and
adventur
on
top
of
anoth
.
there
ar
so
mani
of
these
mini-plot-within-plot
in
thi
film
i
would
not
describ
them
all
becaus
it
is
what
give
the
movi
it
hook
.
the
other
film
have
reli
on
thi
type
of
storytel
,
but
becaus
of
the
limit
of
the
technolog
at
the
time
,
the
film
'
screenplai
were
also
limit
.
the
sens
of
limitless
here
is
what
give
`the
phantom
menac
'
it
uniqu
trait
.
as
we
alreadi
know
,
the
film
take
place
at
least
a
gener
or
two
befor
the
origin
`star

'
trilogi
which
mean
a
lot
of

background
which
wa
unclear
and/or
unexplain
mai
be
clear
up
here
as
it
is
the
begin
of
the
vast
epic
stori
.
and
here
the
most
signific
storylin
is
that
involv

discoveri
of

if
somewhat
unnerv

phenomenon

the
caus
is
associ

whirlwind
.
we
know
that

can
rip
up
land
and
even

of

from

and
final

elsewher

so
while
the
rain
is
possibl
,
some
doubt
do
creep
in
.
the
rain
of
frog
depict
in
thi
film
mai
be
of
greater
scale
than
i
had
pictur
for
a
rain
of

.
it
seem
unlik
the

would
still
be
aliv

it
is
not
clear
that
geograph
condit
ar
right

have
thi
sort
of
phenomenon
.
(
frankli
i
have
no
idea
on
these
point

)
otherwis
the
event
wa
quit
believ
.
what
we
see
in
thi
film
is
much
more
credibl
than
the
phenomena
we
saw
in
volcano
.
in
the
film
it
is
left
ambigu
if
the
rain
is
a
sign
from
god
sinc
there
ar
mani

``
howev
a
rain
of
frog
,
though
it
feel
biblic

is
most
definit
not
a

note

set
thi

an

there
ar
some
honest

score
that

a
rather
unusu
thing
about'the

the
almost
complet
lack

there
ar
no

no

thi
is
a
more
philosoph

,
remind
about

thi
is
off

a
major
disappoint
to

it
lack

which
,
like
in

complet
alien
it
from

the

both

do
.
i
think
raimi
knew
he
had
a
winner
on
hi
hand
and
decid
to
direct
the
pictur
on
a
natur
flow
cours
.
on
of
the
film
's
compon
can
be
link
to
a
recur
theme
in
terrenc
malick
's
the
thin
red
line
.
in
malick
's
three
hour
bore-a-thon
,
he
make
an
interest
attempt
to
link
mother
earth
to
hi
war
stori
.
it
seem
noth
more
than
an
occasion
pretti
cut
to
a
field
of
flow
grass
,
a
small
bird
,
or
a
flow
bodi
of
water
.
sure
,
there
were
obviou
metaphor
connect
,
but
there
wa
no
subtlti
to
hi
effort
.
raimi
doe
a
fine
job
of
ty
in
a
fox
in
a
chicken
coop
and
bird
of
prei
to
signifi
the
futur
of
the
charact
.
i
think
most
viewer
mai
miss
the
comparison
,
but
it
is
a
veri
intrigu
ingredi
in
the
film
.
and
then
there
's
billi
bob
thorton
,
who
is
proof
that
the
independ
film
industri
is
vital
to
the
life
blood
of
hollywood
.
if
it
can
continut
to
produc
peopl
like
thorton
,
hollywood
will
be
ok
.
he
give
a
fantast
and
devastatingli
deep
perform
here
.
it
is
not
as
engross
as
hi
carl
childer
charact
in
slingblad
,
but
is
is
just
as
complex
,
if
not
more
so
.
jacob
is
slow
and
simpl
,
and
yet
we
so
often
see
him
deep
in
thought
.
i
wonder
if
he
wa
think
about
thing
that
he
would
never
sai
(
or
did
n't
know
how
to
sai
)
or
if
he
wa
just
take
a
long
time
to
think
about
the
thing
he
just
said
.
here
he
realli
prove
hi
worth
as
on
of
the
best
charact
actor
in
the
industri
.
though
the
plot
is
somewhat
unorigin
,
it
ha
a
veri
appeal
new
twist
in
it
charact
.
paxton
give
on
of
the
better
perform
of
hi
career
as
the
straight
and
seriou
leader
of
the
group
(
a
far
cry
from

scienc
)
.
perhap
bridget
fonda
is
miscast
as
hi
advic-give
wife
,
but
she
certainli
doe
n't
do
anyth
ruin
the
pictur
.
a
simpl
plan
can
be
includ
in
the
group
of
recent
small
hollywood
film
that
is
just
dark
and
pretti
un-redeem
.
but
at
least
thi
on
ha
an
import
messag
,
unlik
so
mani
of

.
i
saw
simon
birch
in
a
basic
sold
out
theater
,
on
a
sundai
afternoon
.
when
the
movi
wa
over
and
the

wa
exit
,
i
did
n't
hear
on
neg
comment
,
and
i
did
n't
have
ani
to
offer
.
simon
birch
is
primarili
about
the
friendship
of
two
twelv
year
old
boi
,
simon
(
ian
michael
smith
)
and
joe
(
joseph
mazzello
)
,
and
what
destini
hold
for
both
of
them
.
simon
is
a
dwarf
,
who
wa
not
suppos
to
last
through
the
night
after
birth
due
to
a
weak
heart
.
surprisingli
,
he
doe
,
and
now
constantli
remind
everyon
that
he
is
a
live
miracl
.
simon
think
god
ha
a
plan
for
him
,
a
purpos
for
hi
life
,
and
hi
condit
,
he
just
doe
n't
know
what
.
joe
is
an
illegitim
child
(
refer
to
both
comic
and
dramat
throughout
the
film
as
a
bastard
)
,
who
's
mom
(
ashlei
judd
)
wo
n't
tell
him
who
hi
father
is
.
simon
ha
more
than
just
dwarfism
as
a
problem
,
the
peopl
in
the
town
do
n't
realli
like
him
,
becaus
he
is
n't
``
natur
``
.
even
hi
own

do
n't
care
about
him
,
and
ar
disappoint

the
onli
person
,
other
than

,
that
realli
care
for
simon
is
joe
's
mom
,
who
he
also
look
up
to
as
a

.
it
would
be
just
simon
's
luck
,
that
he
would
accident
kill
joe
's

,
someth
you
ar
told
at
the

joe
,
now
motherless
as
well
as

,
feel
the
need
to
find
out
who
hi

with

of
ben

enough
with

let
's
get
to
the
review

the
film
revolv
around
the
kidnap
of
peter
bowman
(
david

,
an
american
engin
work
in
south
america
who
is
kidnap

a
mass

of
civilian
by
anti-govern
soldier
.
upon
discov
hi
ident
,
the
rebel
soldier
decid
to
ransom
him
for
$
6
million
.
the
onli
problem
is
that
the
compani
peter
bowman
work
for
is
be
auction
off
,
and
no
on
will
step

when

thei
alwai
do
in

terri
and
hi
team
(
which
includ
the
most
surpris
cast
choic
of
the
year
:
david
caruso
)
take
matter
into
their
own

.
the
film
is
notabl
in
that
it
take

creat
a

charact-driven
vehicl
fill
with
well-written
dialogu
,
shade
of
motiv
,
and
convinc
act
by
all
the

the
script
is
base
on
both
a
book
(

the

when

jean
is
nowher
to
be
found
.
she
contact
author
,
but
thei
ca
n't
find
him
either
.
did
he
disappear
to
start
a
new
life
?
wa
he
kill
by
accid
?
did
he
commit
suicid
?
mari
still
ask
herself
these
question
a
year
later
,
and
in
order
to
move
on
with
her
life
,
she
must
find
some
answer
.
it
's
a
fine
premis
,
and
thi
littl

us
it
to
the
limit
.
the
film
move
at
a
leisur
pace
,
a
bit
slow
,
but
relax
.
it
's
a
veri

stori
,
and
you
can
pretti
much
just
sit
back
without

thi
is
mostli
thank
to
the
excel

work
by

who
shot
the

in

the

rampl
is
so
express
in

portray
of

,
you
connect
with

instantli
,
despit
that

the

in

is
rather

compar
to

,
it
's

like

`under

while

it
's
a

citi
,
of
jame

postpon
from

,
with
an

budget
that
make
it
the
most
expens
movi
in

,
thi
wa
on

i
wa
eager
to
preview
.
so
,
is
thi
movi
go
to
sink
or
swim
thi
holidai
?
my
best
guess
.
.
.
.
it
will
sink
,
though
with
mani
award
attatch
to
it
hull
.
no
doubt
,
titan
is
the
most
elabor
disast
movi
ever
made
.
it
boast
the
most
amaz
effect
that
i
have
ever
seen
done
to
date
.
to
see
a
ship
fall
apart
,
with
actual
peopl
run
across
the
ship
,
fly
across
the
deck
,
and
fall
to
the
water
,
is
just
amaz
to
look
at
.
the
effect
ar
so
stunningli
realist
,
you
would
swear
you
were
look
at
actual
footag
.
but
titan
is
more
than
a
disast
movi
,
and
that
's
where
the
problem
li
.
there
is
a
love
stori
attatch
that
nearli
ruin
the
entir
premis
.
i
'll
give
a
capsul
summari
of
the
stori
without
spoil
anyth
for
you
:
the
film
begin
with
a
modern
dai
excav
of
sort
of
the
sunken
titan
.
we
see
actual
footag
of
the
sunken
ship
,
as
cammeron
had
set
up
special
camera
to
film
the
wreckag
on
the
ocean
floor
.
bill
paxton
lead
the
expedit
,
in
search
of
sunken
treasur
.
what
he
find
instead
,
lead
him
to
a
mysteri
old
woman
who
recount
her
tale
of
the
titan
voyag
.
we
meet
rose
(
kate
winslet
)
,
a
young
woman
,
who
come
from
an
upper-class
famili
.
rose
is
to
be
wed
to
a
man
she
doe
not
love
.
we
meet
jack
(
leonardo
dicaprio
)
,
a
young
man
,
who
come
from
a
poor
financi
background
,
and
win
a
ticket
aboard
the
titan
,
in
a
poker
game
.
the
two
meet
under
interest
circumst
,
and
the
love
stori
begin
.
add
in
a
jealou
fianc
,
and
a
not-so-nice
law
offic
plai
by
david
warner
,
and
you
have
a
stori
that
,
well
,
get
a
bit
overplai
and
oversappi
.
i
must
add
,
at
thi
point
,
that
the
most
likeabl
charact
in
the
movi
is
plai
by
kathi
bate
,
as
a
woman
with
``
new
monei
``
who
is
a
lot
less
uptight
than
the
other
rich
folk
on
the
ship
.
she
is
a
pleasur
to
see
on
screen
.
when
the
ship
doe
hit
the
iceberg
at
exactli
1
:
40

the
film
,
and
eventu
sink
,
you
never
realli
feel
for
ani
of
these
charact
.
the
film
is
just
load
with
unlik
rich
snob
and
other
folk
you
never
realli
get
a
grasp
on
.
the
effect
ar
tremend
.
from
the
roar
of

in

to
a

ship
crack
at

,
thi

an

it

the

with

fairli
standard
stuff

of

but
spielberg
and

it
well
enough
that
it
still

more
than
just

the

examin

the
biggest
success
of

is
probabl
the
character

still
,
there
is
n't
enough
of
thi
for
it
to
be

the
main
flaw
in
thi
film
,
which
prevent
it
from

is
that
it
seem

after
all

,

,
and
cool
trailer
,
men
in

is
not
the
best
movi
of
the
summer
.
it
's
pretti
good
in
it
's
own
right
,
ye
,
but
i
would
probabl
split
the
``

``
honor
among
face/off
,
spawn
,
con
air
,
and
mayb
event
horizon
.
it
's
main
problem
is
that
it
's
quickli
forgett
,
and
i
ca
n't
rememb
on
truli
good
scene
from
it
.
from
con
air
,
it
wa
the
scene
out
in
the
desert
when
thei
were
dig
the
plane
out
from
the
dirt
.
in

,
it
wa

it

and
all
of
face/off
wa
pretti
dang
good
.
but
as
for
men
in

,
the
onli
scene
i
still
recal
is
when
will
smith
is
squish
all
those
giant
roach
.
i
rememb
it
not
for
it
's
humor
but
becaus
i
am
hate
roach
with
a
passion
and
wa
pretti
disgust
.
and
ye
,
i
did
see
mimic
,
which
is
someth
i
'll
touch
on
in
a
later
review
.
back
to
men
in
black
(
is
it
just
me
,
or
doe
that
sound
funni
?
)
i
rememb
first
hear
about
men
in
black
back
when
i
wa
a
comic
geek
in
the
7th
grade
and
read
magazin
like
wizard
,
etc
.
(
for
those
of
you
who
ar
n't
comic-geek
,
wizard
is
basic
to

what

okai
,
that
on
wa
pretti
pathet
.
)
few
peopl
know
thi
,
but
men
in
black
is
base
on
a
veri
obscur
comic
book
that
wa
,
while
not
honest-politician-rare
,
veri
hard
to
find
.
thi
wa
after
the
releas
of
the
high-gross

and
it
said
that
tommi

and
chri

were
be
consid

the
role
(
in
the
comic
book
,
there
were
no
black
men
in

.
kind
of
weird
,
huh
?
)
all
i
can
sai
is
,
thank
god
thei
did
n't
cast
chri
o'donnel
.
i
know
i
ca
n't
be
the
onli

on

who
think
he
's
an
annoi
,
preppi

.
.
sorri
.
my
apolog
to
o'donnel
fan
.
i
actual
had
a
7th
grade
teacher
who
wa
a
big
comic
collector
and
wa
set
to
bui
some
of
the
comic
from
him
,
anticip
rather
craftili
that
,
if
the
movi
wa
a
big
hit
,
it
would
drive
up
the
price
of
the
comic
rather
nice
.
he
decid
not
to
sell
them
to
me
,
becaus
thei
were
``

.
hmm
.
.
.
.
so
now
you
're
probabl
wonder
why
i
've
wast
about
5

i
'll

the

there

with

humor-wise
,
the
film
ha
a
good
number
of
joke
which
maintain
my
interest
throughout

there
ar
memor
moment

the

to

thi
is

when
the

meet
up
with
some
member
of
the
cattl

from

there
were
also
some
part
which
appear
unrealist
,
like
whether
the

start

it
did
or
why
thei
did
n't

get

(

,
i
also
found
it

i
'd
sai
that
the

defici
make

it

i
applaud
the

for
not

instead
keep

most

after

make
the

wonder
``
ok
,
now
how
do
thei
get
out
of
thi
?
``
.
the
stake
keep
rais
(
much
like
in

,
an
excel
action-thriller
)
,
and
even
though
the
audienc
know
how
the
film
will
end
,
it
's
a
lot
of
fun
get
there
.
i
onli
have
two
minor
complaint
about
the
entir
film
.
the
first
come
from
the
scene
which
follow
the
open
sequenc
.
while
their
purpos
is
to
introduc
us
to
the
charact
and
to
get
the
stori
go
(
which
thei
do
)
,
i
feel
as
though
it
could
have
been
done
much
quicker
,
and
less
convention
.
i
mean
,
did
we
realli
have
to
see
the
ship
's
crew
at
a
wed
?
becaus
of
that
,
you
now
know
exactli
what
's
go
to
happen
to
the
groom
!
my
other
gripe
would
be
dure
the
film
's
final
.
there
's
an
explos
which
end
the
film
that
is
on
of
the
weakest
look
cgi
effect
sinc
the
presid
's
plane
crash
into
the
ocean
at
the
end
of
air
forc
on
.
i
can
not
stress
thi
enough
.
.
.
until
a
cgi
effect
can
be
made
to
look
like
a
model
effect
,
stick
with
us
model
.
ye
,
u-571
is
histor
incorrect
and
there
ar
sure
some
specif
in
the
plot
that
peopl
who
have
been
onboard
a
submarin
will
tell
you
``
that
could
n't
happen
``
,
but
the
overal
point
of
thi
film
is
entertain
.
it
succe
fantast

these

what

mckellar

some
of
the
most
interest
charact
i
've
seen
in

in

these
peopl
all
felt
real
to
me
,
especi
the
charact
plai
by
sandra

.
we
can
see
her
desper
,
her
utter
need
to
be
with
her
husband
in
the
final
hour
.
renni
is
good
,
too

as
the

who
want

liter
try

befor

di
.
he
exud
such

likeabl
,
it
's
not
surpris
that
we
're
root
for
him
to
get
what
he
want
.
but
for
me
,
the
biggest
surpris
in
the
movi
is
mckellar
.
i
knew
that
he
wa
a
talent
director
,
but
i
had
no
idea
he
could
act
as
well
.
hi
insist
to
be
alon
,
much
to
the
dismai
of
hi
parent
,
is
someth
that
most
peopl
would
find
difficult
to
understand
,
but
as
plai
by
mckellar
,
we
can
understand
hi
reason
.
he
doe
n't
bui
into
the
whole
notion
that
just
becaus
everyon
's
go
to
die
,
he
should
immedi
find
some
companionship
.
he
realiz
the
relationship
would
be
forc
,
and
thei
would
onli
be
togeth
for
the
sake
of
be
togeth
.
mckellar
give
a
brilliant
perform
,
and
i
hope
he
altern
between
direct
and
act
.
my
onli
quibbl
with
the
film
is
that
we
never
find
out
why
the
world
is
end
.
i
realli
want
to
know
,
and
my
need
to
know
wa
hang
over
the
film
at
all
time
.
i
appreci
the
fact
that
mckellar
did
n't
want
the
materi
to
rule
the
film
,
and
that
he
want
the
movi
to
be
more
of
a
studi
in
human
behavi
.
howev
,
in
not
tell
the
audienc
what
the
caus
of
earth
's
destruct
is
,
he
's
left
a
big
question
that
is
in
their
mind
throughout
the
film
.
anoth
problem
is
we
never
see
anybodi
panick
.
i
would
imagin
if
the
world
wa
end
,
and
there
wa
noth
to
be
done
about
it
,
a
larg
segment
of
the
popul
would
be
go
out
of
their
mind
.
instead
,
we
ar
treat
to
shot
of
a
giant
crowd
parti
like
it
's
new
year
's
ev
.
i
just
did
n't
bui
the
fact
that
everyon
had
complet
accept
their
fate
.
no
on
had
the
urg
to
``

that

about

'm
a

i
'll
enjoi

in

i

do

the

time

that
i
have

if
it

with

full
of

it

out

after

i

thi

can
act

will

he
doe

the

aris

both
jack

becom
obsess

on
anoth
,
though
their
respect
job
make
them
superfici
incompat

we
soon
learn
that
the
film
is
not
told
in
sequenc
(
and
,
sinc
thi
is
a
gritti
crime
comedi
,
flashback
of
pulp
fiction
should
aris
)
.
at
first
,
i
kind
of
felt
that
it
wa
a
gimmick
,
but
i
guess
it
wa
a
gimmick
in
pulp
fiction
,
too
.
it
's
a
fun
gimmick
,
though
,
and
soderbergh
treat
the
materi
with
enough
humor
that
everyth
come
off
natur

i
've
onli
seen
a

of
soderbergh
's

(
i
wa
impress
both
with
kafka
and
sex
,
li
,
and
videotap
)
,
but
i
think
he
's
excel
at
what
he
doe
.
he
's
an
artist
without
make
it
obviou
,
and
without
be
pretenti
,
which
is
alwai
admir
.
he
us
trick
,
ye
(
lot
of
freez-frame
stuff
here
)
,
but
it
all
add
to
the
smooth
and
quirki
current
in
the
film
.
as
i
said
,
cloonei
is
terrif
,
and
he
's
match
by
lopez
.
lopez
is
,
of
cours
,
beauti
,
but
she
can
act
,
too
.
i
can
sens
that
she
's
hone
in
on
her
skill
,
for
she
come
off
more
natur
here
than
she
ha
in
ani
of
her
previou
ventur
(
not
that
stone
gave
her

loathsom

.
the
two
actor
have
arrest
chemistri
with
on
anoth
--
the
best
scene
in
the
film
,
by
far
,
is
the
seduct
scene
.
the
brillianc
of
thi
scene
is
also
due
,
in
part
,
to
soderbergh
,
for
he
cut
back
and
forth
from
their
quiet
discuss
in
a
bar
to
the
physic
act
which
take
place
a
few
minut
later
.
the
scene
is
a
seri

soft
nuanc

glanc

layer
upon

,
and
the
result
is
on
of

the

what
realli
is

is
that
even
though
there
ar
ton
of
charact
in
sever
unrel
stori
,
the
film
is
never
confus
.
anderson
's
control
over
transit
from
on
stori
to
anoth
stori
is
master
.
he
also
know
exactli
when
to
cut

not
on
of

too
long

ani
three

film
that
doe
not
deliv
even
on

is
definit
worth
recommend
.
from
the
fascin

to
the
riski
yet
surprisingli
satisfi

the
film
just
doe
n't
get
bore
.
it
is
obviou
that
anderson
put
a
lot
of
time
into
connect
each
subplot
.
thi
is
the
ultim
game
of

separ

the
fact
that
each

so
differ

yet
so
similar
show
that
there
ar
univers
pain
that
all

anderson
's
explan

thi

thi

becaus

he

appar
tarantino
wa
so
impress
that
he
help
braddock
convert
thi
into
a
featur-length
film
.
there
ar
other
parallel
-
the
star
of
curdl
is
angela
jone
(
the
top
bill
goe
to
william
baldwin
,
but
realli
,
jone
is
the
central
charact
)
,
who
's
probabl
best
known
for
her
role
as
esmerelda
villalobo
,
the
death-obssess
taxi
driver
in
pulp
fiction
.
that
role
wa
written
specif
for
jone
base
upon
her
similar
charact
in
the
aforement
short
film
,
curdl
jr
.
jone
is
great
in
curdl
-
she
's
wonderfulli
funni
and
maintain
an
amus
wide-ei
naiv
curious
about
murder
without
compromis
her
charact
's
innoc
or
likeabl
.
she
can
express
so
much
with
on
lift
of
her
eyebrow
.
it
's
a
great
perform
.
reb
braddock
's
direct
is
extrem
sharp
and
clever
,
toe
the
line
between
black
humour
and
bad
tast
.
the
best
scene
in
the
film
is
an
outrag
funni
sequenc
involv
jone
and
danc
-
ani
more
than
that
would
be
a
spoiler
.
the
open

sequenc
is
also

of

,
it
's
imposs
to
realli
take
thi
stuff
serious

but
then
again
you
're
not

braddock
know
the
audienc
is
in
on
the
joke
,
and
make
it
a
fun
littl
romp
as
a
result
.
the
on
drawback
of
curdl
is
that
it
wa
base
on
a
short
film
,
and
it
feel
like
it
;
the
materi
is
just

it

that
is

stop

the

(
the

consist

lot
of
in-joke
of
how
the
boat
wo
n't

and
most
of
the

pretti
basic

it
's

as

there

,
there

there

the

to

everyon

the
abil

the

masterpiec
the

,
which
is
known

,
is
a
prime
exampl
of
how
a
good

can
becom
an
instant
classic
as
a

for

,
i

heard
of

after

i

the

at
thi
point
,
the
differ
in

realli
kick
in

the
intern

contain
an
addit
24
minut
of
footag
that
pertain
directli
to
the
relationship
of
l

footag
that
american

deem
``

feel
that
defin

is
too
much
for

the
best
part
of
thi
extra
footag
is
that
give
better
understand
of
both
mathilda

on

motiv
pertain
to
later
action
involv

there
's
even
a

with
these
addit
scene
replac

l

on

matilda

bring
you
emotion
closer
to
the
film
and
draw
stronger
bond
between
the
charact
that
were
murki
in
the
american
version
.
the
most
iron
thing
about
the
intern
version
of
the
film

also
fail

what

is
the
small

about

the
answer
to
these
question
can
best
be
answer
by
either
good
scienc
or
art
,
which
ar
both
close
relat
to
the
american

that

that
thi
work
fail
to
be
subtl
and
polar
opinion
,
leav
no
room
for
deeper
argument
,
is
the
shame
of
thi
decent
and
smart
film
,
that
tri
so
hard
to
sai
what
it
felt
it
had
to
sai
but
said
it
so
loudli
without
trust
it
audienc
to
catch
on
to
it
messag
by
not
make
everyth
seem
so
black

white
.
no
tell
said
a
lot
about
the
harm
trend
it
see
scienc
go
in
;
it
probabl
said
too
much
and
would
have
been
better
off
if
it
vision
wa
more
poetic

less

there
is
someth
about
listen
to
a
lectur
that
turn
off
the
rebel
in
me
,
as
i
do
n't
like
be
hit
in
the
head
with
the
truth
but
prefer
to
have
it
present
in
the
form
that
lead
to
inspir
or
told
metaphor
.
that
is
not
to
sai
that
i
found
the
film
without
consider
merit
,
that
inspit
of

shortcom
,
it
wa
worth
see
becaus
of
it
visual
statement
,
though
thei
were
also
not

subtl
,
thei
were
at

effect
in
set
up
the
intens
mood
that
the

need
to
show
that
there
is
a

go
on

,
of
those
who
believ
on
wai
is
right
and
other
who
differ
with
them
,
and
that
anyon
who
is
neutral
must
be
consid
an

becaus
of
their
indiffer
.
the
stake
in
thi
ecolog
struggl
ar
that
high
.
perhap
the
most
power
visual
statement
in
the
film
,
wa
the
dead
cow
from
pesticid
shown
in
the
open
scene
.
it
wa
the
imag
that
lillian
spent
her
time
paint
all
summer
and
had
the
same
affect
for
her
as
did
the
anim
face
in
picasso
's
guernica
had
for
him
.
both
artist
envis
the
horror
that
man
could
do
against
the
world
,
and
repres
thi
unspoken
pain
on
the
face
of
the
anim
so
that
anyon
who
care
to
realli
see
what
is
go
on
,
will
not
mistak
which
side
of
the
fenc
he
or
she
should
be
on
.
the
pain
that
lillian
feel
,
as
she
forget
about
her
desir
to
rais
a
famili
,
and
she
stare
at
her
paint
of
the
cow
and
the
song
,
``

14

on

a
16
year
old
who
certainli
is
a
beauti
,
with
love

hair
and
a
sweet
,
innoc
complexion
.
maggi
seem
to
be
a
littl
disturb
by
thi
littl

her
,
but
somehow
he
interest
her
,
and
soon
thei

get
to

thei
gradual
becom

and
spend

such
as

who
come
out
of

onc
everi
17
year
)
,
plai
tenni
,
and
listen
to
a
symphoni
orchestra
through
a
manhol
cover
.
luca
is
obvious
in
love
with
maggi
,
and
while
she
is
charm
by
him
,
it
's
clear
that
she
would
never
consid
him
anyth
more
than
a
veri
good
friend
.
thi
is
not
clear
to
luca
,
howev
.
he
still
beleiv
that
maggi
is
hi
soulmat
,
and
he
dread
the
impend
start
of
school
becaus
he
know
what
's
about
to
happen
.
we
soon
find
out
why
in
a
pain
scene
where
luca
is
humili
by
the
jock
dure
a
pep
ralli
.
thei
throw
him
on
stage
,
right
in
front
of
hi
belov
maggi
.
surprisingli
,
he
turn
the
tabl
on
the
jock
with
some
clown
around
,
but
he
take
it
too
far
,
and
is
embarass
in
front
of
the
entir
school
.
the
next
scene
is
brilliant
.
maggi
follow
luca
outsid
of
the
pep
ralli
.
she
tri
to
talk
to
him
as
if
noth
happen
.
he
rail
back
against
her
,
in
a
cruel
unfair
fashion
.
in
lesser
movi
thi
would
've
turn
into
a
confront
between
the
two
charact
.
but
maggi
is
written
smarter
than
that
.
she
understand
what
luca
is
feel
and
know
exactli
what
to
sai
to
consol
him
.
next
we
ar
introduc
to
anoth
great
charact
name
cappi
(
charli
sheen
)
.
he
is
a
jock
with
a
typic
cheerlead
girlfriend
.
what
's
interest
about
him
is
that
he
stick
up
for
luca
and
protect
him
from
the
other
jock
.
of
cours
anyon
with
a
brain
can
tell
what
's
gon
na
happen
next
.
cappi
will
caus
conflict
in
maggi
and
luca
'
relationship
.
thi
begin
in
classic
scene
in
the
school
laundri
room
when
cappi
and
maggi
ar
alon
.
she
's
been
assign
to
show
him
how
to
oper
the
washer/dryer
so
he
can
clean
hi
shirt
.
maggi
is
charm
by
cappi
's
tender
undertsand
demeanor
,
not
to
mention
hi
shirtless
bodi
.
thi
scene
is
so
delic
and
sweet
,
but
cappi
still
ha
a
girlfriend
,
prevent
either
on
from
act
on
their
desir
.
desper
try
to
punctur
the
tension
,
cappi
begin
to
kick
basketbal
around
the
room
.
it
's
not
long
befor
cappi
doe
break
up
with
hi
girlfriend
(
in
the
film
onli
subpar
scene
)
.
luca
final
figur
out
what
's
go
on
when
he
tri
to
pick
maggi
up
for
the
danc
.
thi
caus
him
to
take
sever
action
to
prove
himself
to
maggi
and
himself
,
such
as
try
out
for
the
footbal
team
.
the
last
third
of
the
film
revolv
around
thi
attempt
.
while
the
idea
seem
clich
,
the
wai
it
is
execut
is
not
.
there
ar
mani

the
last
half

which
lead
to
an

why

in
term

by

the

the

that
of

ar
all
written
to
be
free-think

be
,
and
ar
all
likabl

but
flaw
,
peopl
who
ar
constantli
interest
,
as
is
the
film
itself
.
on
highli
origin
element
of
the

sometim

sometim
it
turn
out
to
be
subtl

on
sequenc
that
stand
out
is
when

read
a

an

in

she
is
even

i

she
find
the
right

for
each

hold
it

and
devito
ha
never
had
such
a
humanist

i

surpris
about

usual
he
is
us
as
the
butt

in
thi

,
ha
a
live-and-breath

top
it

off

anoth
joi
of

that
it
doe
not

,
in

the

the

shot
ha
becom
as
ubiquit
to
the
altman

as
the
director
cameo
wa
to

is
it
old-school
sexism

a
clever
in-joke
?
you

judg

but
back
to
the
pictur
at

.
in
the
hand
of
a
mere
mortal
,
the
gingerbread
man
would
have
been
a
routin
thriller
,
no
better
or
wors
than
the
countless
other
we
've
all
endur
.
in
the
hand
of
a
master
like
altman
,
it
becom
an
exercis
in
existenti

,
in
it

wai

more
success
than

which
tri

what

prevent
it

a
weak
third

-
in
fact
,
there
realli
is
no
third
act
in
grisham
's
stori
,
so
it
appear
that
altman
had
to
throw
in
the
hurrican
just
to
jazz
thing
up

but
there
ar
true
moment

by

davidzt

more
than
enough
to
see
you
through

that

thi

thei
tri

altman

then
buri
the

when
he

back
,
should
tell
you
how
utterli

that
is

do

not

the

in

thi

1974

he
must
have
seen
a

i
read
the
book
about
five
year

huge
enjoi
it
.
the
open
of
a
simpl

remind
me
a
bit
of
the
sweet
hereaft
.
the
landscap
is
snowi
and
cold
,
and
is
film
what
i
feel
is
in
a
rather
crisp
manner
(
which
also
remind
me
of
fargo
(
which
i
loath
)
)
.
on
can
almost
sens
the
cold
.
but
the
movi
far
from
the
ey
pop
delight
of
the
quick
and
the
dead
,
instead
raimi
ha
made
a
more
constrain
film
--
which
probabl
is
for
the
better
.
thi
is
probabl
not
a
movi
that
would
have
been
improv
by
lot
of
odd
shot

the
movi
also
remind
me
of
afflict

as
the
lead
charact
all
seem
to
be
hope
for
and
see
a
possibl
to
lead
a
better
life
than
their
father
,
and
thei
see
a
chanc
for
such
a
dream
to
come

thi
chanc
is

,
some
of

ar
present

the
right

but
do
the
right
thing
might
not
result
in
a
better
result
than
someth
more
selfish
.
the
movi
's
biggest
strength
is
that
it
fact
make
sens
.
i
have
seen
mani
movi
base
on
book
that
just
seem
like
select

from

,
eschew
anyth
remot
resembl
a
coher
stori
--
for
exampl
clear
and
present
danger
.
the
biggest
problem
seem
to
over-familiar
with
the
stori
.
the
writer
perhap
feel
that
he
doe
n't
have
to
present
scene
that
ar
clear
to
him
,
but
the
lack
of
which
onli
baffl
an
audienc

ha
not

thi
is
definit
not
the
problem
with
a
simpl

,
even
though
the
screenplai
is
by
the

the
movi
is
alwai
clear

howev
,
it
take
over
an

for

be
introduc

the
film
open
with
a
ridicul
present
dai

which
contain
a
scene
that
jab
at

about
how
all

ar
inbr
and
redneck
.
not
onli
is
thi
observ
entir
pointless
and
out
of
place
,
but
it
is
also
hacknei
beyond
all
belief
.
as
the
film
flash
back
to
1935
,
graham

is
quickli
execut
without
ani
introduct
.
hi
death
seem
veri
rush
and
without
ani
knowledg
of
who
he
is
,
the
scene
is
neither
sad
nor
convinc
.
green
is
not
even
given
a
final
word
,
like
some
of
the
other
charact
,
and
we
do
n't
even
see
him
walk
the
infam
green

howev
,
as
the

begin
to
specif
introduc

charact
,
such
as
coffei
and
eduard

well
as

the
film
becom
more

the
speed
in

is
perfect
.
if
time
wa
a
matter
of
concern
and
the
film
wa
edit
to
the
two
hour
mark
,
it
would
have
been
unsatisfactori
becaus
we
would
not
be
abl
to
know
the
charact
as
thei
ar
or
as
thei
treat

.
the
three
hour
run
is
perfect
for

develop
and
by
the
end
of
the
film
,
a
great
amount
of
love

is
attach

the
most

not

becaus

becaus
thei
ar
in

state
of
furi

not

against

within

the

ar
constantli
shown
as
sexual
assault

ar
alwai
on

also
unlik

what

most
notabl
of
all
is
the
method
kaufman
us
in
order
to
suggest
the
passag
of

.
the
begin
of

show

indulg
himself
in
hors

just
few
yard
awai
from
the
fastest
and
most
preciou
aircraft
in
the
world
.
in
that
set
,
it
's
quit
normal
for
import
technic
problem
to
be
solv
with
simpl
chainsaw
and
for
the
test
pilot
not
to
report
their
rib
be
broken
befor
most
import
flight
.
but
the
time
ar
chang
;
ww2
allianc
with
ussr
is
replac
with
cold

,
and
``

like

must
be
replac
with
more
disciplin
,
convent
pilot
.
their
entir
live
becom
focu
of

frenzi
,
and
their
job
is
subject
to
strict

,
meticul

and
thei
must
fight
the
bureaucrat

to

thi

those

achiev

great

provid
mani
memor
scene

(
the

.
although
kaufman
enjoi
support
of

provid
authent

he
still
had
to
us
special

thei
can
still
fool

anoth
fine

i
still

it

thi

is
great

and
it

well
deserv
,
but
there
ar
some
minor
flaw
.
some
of
the
``

n't
flesh
out
enough
(
although
be
plai
by
fine

like

)
.
film
also
lack
proper
closur
.
on
the
other
hand
,
most
logic
conclus
of
the
film
-
land
on
the
moon
-
would
requir
thi
film
to
be
more
than
six
hour
long
.
also
,
some
critic
were
prone
to
attack
thi
film
as
too
amerocentr
and
hard
on
russian
,
who
were
portrai
as
evil
monster
,
just
in
line
with
most
virul
cold
war
rhetor
of
reagan
's
america
.
in
some
of
contemporari
interview
,
kaufman
defend
that
approach
by
claim
that
he
want
to
make
film
as
authent
as
possibl
,
and
in
order
to
do
that
,
he
portrai
russian
not
as
thei
were
in
real
life
,
but
as
thei
were
perceiv
by
american
in
earli
1960s
.
time
ha
pass
;
now
we
do
n't
see
astronaut
as
hero
.
in
thi
ag
of
widespread
satellit
commun
and
routin
space
mission
,
those
men
and
women
in
space
suit
ar
seen
as
mere
mainten
worker
.
few
young
boi
want
to
be
astronaut
when
thei
grow
up
.
but
thi
film
,
sentiment
remind
of
the
time
``
when
futur
began
``
,
perhap
could
encourag
at
least
some
of
them
to
follow
``

'
footstep
seek
new
frontier
in
the
sky
.
and
even
if
thei
decid
to
stai
on
earth
,
thei
could
still
appreci
the
right
stuff
as
an
extraordinari
piec
of

.
i
find
most
of
televis
so
intens
bore
that
i
simpli
never
turn
on
my
set
,
unless
i
'm
watch
a
movi
.
i
do
n't
even
have

so
i
went
to
radio
shack
to
bui
an

specif
for
the
purpos
of
watch
``
the

everi
sundai

it
's
the
onli
show
that
's
worth
an
hour
of
my
time
each

(
though

sinc
i
do

'm
glad

six

of

i
am
an
avid
fan
of
the
show
,
and
have
been
for
about
three
year
now
.
and
i
love
gillian
anderson
.
the
x-file
is
the
film
that
continu
the
stori
where
the
season
final
left
off
.
the
film
is
like
a
two-hour
episod
,
except
that
there
ar
a
lot
more
special
effect
,
the
plot
is
thicker
,
and
the
resolut
is
more
satisfi
.
thi
is
a
terrif
film
,
both
for
fan
of
the
seri
and
for
those
who
have
never
seen
it
(
i
imagin
that
viewer
unfamiliar
with
the
show
will
find
the
film
to
be
solid
and
rivet
entertain
)
.
i
expect
to

more
than
ani

when

the

and
our

there
ar

(

the

veri

and
the
product

by
christoph

is

what
i
find
interest
is
that
the
x-file
is
actual
a
great
wai
for
seri
neophyt
to
get
into
the

.
our
hero
ar
given
subtl
introduct
(
we
're
not
expect
to
know
them
on
the
outset
)
,
and
the
film
explain
enough
of
the
stori
that
prior
knowledg
of
the
seri
is
n't
requir
to
understand
the
film
.
there
ar
,
of
cours
,
littl
element
that
the
maker
have
includ
as
payoff
to
the
fan
,
but
i
'll
keep
those
as
surpris

it
take
a
lot
of
thought
and
understand
of
the
seri
to
creat
a
film
us
root
as
complic
as
the
on
that
the

provid
,
and
then
creat
a
coher
film
that
anyon
can

the

is
strong
for
a

of

it
's
origin
(

ti

``

ow
some

duchovni
ha
so
much
presenc

and
is
just
a
fun
gui
to
watch
.
he
ha
that
confid
that
will
somedai
make
him
into

anderson
is

she
's
also
a
strong
actress
.
both
perform
have
act
in

i

thei
'll
both

chanc

i

recommend
the

both
for

1998

thi

leav

it

at

to
be

we
get
introduc

everyon

simplist
and
realist
(
no

the

we

meet

soon
the

the

about

notic

is
that
the

the

a

with

hollywood

(

and
for
some
reason
,
hollywood
ha
never
taken
a
look
at
the

the
closest
,
that

the
differ
between

is
simpl
:
gattaca

for
us
to
identifi

for
the

sinc
the
begin
of

,
there
come
a

doe

with
just
the

amount
of

that
,
to
me
,
is
what
make
a

in

there
were
a
coupl
of
other

such
as

other

were
not

kind

had
more
than
a

to

upon
a

he
found
the

to
be

condemn
mr

as

'
there
have
been
so
mani
other
bad
review
like
thi

too

my
suggest
:
disregard
the
critic
.
thei
just
have
a
big
problem
with
touch

,
and
on
should
never
pai

thi
dog
of
flander
mai
onli
be
a
littl
`famili
'
movi
(
it
probabl
wo
n't
be
a
big
hit
in
the
style
of
titan
,
but
then
again
no
other
film
ha
been
sinc
then
)
,
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
and
of
itself
.
thi
is
a
stori
that
is
sure
to
warm
your
heart
,
and
that
is
what
realli
matter
about
a
dog
of
flander
.
it
is
also
on
of
the
better
famili
film
around
thi
year
.
none
of
the
other
film
i
have
seen
thi
year
(
though
thei
were
good
)
have
been
so
low-kei
and
touch
.
if
you
're
look
for
famili-style
entertain
,
look
no
further
than
thi
charm
boi-and-dog
yarn
.
go
see
it
while
you
still

it

not

see
it

can

there
is
realli
no

to
compar

as

do

have

ar
there
ani
unwritten

an

movi

would
or
should
follow
?
natur
we
do
n't
want
to
go
into
a
film
with
ani
preconceiv
notion
,
which
is
pretti
tough
but
someth
we
all
have
to
accomplish
.
secondli
,
and
along
the
same
line
,
we
ca
n't
prejudg
a
film
becaus
of
it
's
star
,
director
,
etc
.
the
differ
?
well
,
in
the
first
on
,
we
'd
go
into
a
film
think
it
's
go
to
be
dumb
or
it
's
go
to
be
good
,
and
that
would
affect
our
view
(
that
movi
sound
and
look
dumb
,
so
i
'm
not
expect
much
)
.
on
the
second
hand
,
we
're
simpli
assum
it
will
be
bad
or
good
becaus
of
a

``
grudg

make
sens
?
ok
,
but
what
about
compar

is
n't
that
kind
of
along

when
we
compar
a
certain
actor
or

or
even
compos
's
credibl
in
on

to
anoth
thei
were
involv

is
that
realli
fair

sure
,
in
sequel
you
can
expect
and
accept
comparison
a
lot
more
,
but
what
about
jacki
brown
,
for
exampl
?
is
it
fair
for
me
to
take
the
review
and
turn
it
into
a
comparison
of
pulp
fiction
,
just
becaus
quentin
tarantino
direct
and
wrote
the
screenplai
for
both
?
i
think
it
is
,
and
i
'll
tell
you
why
.
a
good
critic
should
be
abl
to
view
the
film
from
the
``
averag
joe
(
or
jane
)
``
viewpoint
,
while
still
take
into
account
the
artist
integr
behind
the
film
.
sometim
that
can
be
tough
.
``
the
act
wa
superb
,
but
i
wa
bore
``
or
``
i
love
it

!
it
wa

``
might
be
us
to
describ
a

these
ar
contradict
,
and
a
critic
ha
to
weigh
both
side
and
come
to
a
suitabl
balanc

but
which
is
more
import

and
which
is

an

that

wan
na
go

get
back
to

point
,
my

why

it

it
make
for

becaus
we

get

it

for

do
n't

anoth

you
'll
be
satisfi

for

thi

it

wear
the

of

but
it
function
best
as

the
most
controversi
moment
in
the

happen
when

humili
a

ask
him
how
badli
he
want

succe
in

,
then
forc
him
to
prove

in

the
scene
is
charg
with
racism
and
fraught
with
peril
.
could
it
happen
in
the
real
world
?
probabl
not
.
taken
as
allegori
,
howev
,
it
is
repres
of
the
treatment
of
the
meek
by
the
power
in
all
facet
of
societi
.
mayb
it
's
just
the
english
major
in
me
,
but
chad
,
in
hi
motiveless
cruelti
toward
christin
and
hi
care
manipul
of
howard
,
can
be
seen
as
a
symbol
of
unbridl
capit
,
of
greed
without
conscienc
.
the
entir
film
is
a
metaphor
for
social
darwin-
onli
the
strong
will
surviv
.
the
marvel
of
labut
's
multi-layer
script
is
that
it
can
disturb
each
member
of
it
audienc
in
an
entir

doe
the

but
by

film
we
still

noth
about

.
likewis
,
chad
and
howard
ar
simpli
the
sum
of
their
action
.
by
the
end
of
the
film
you
'll
feel
as
if
you
've
met
a
genuin
monster
in
chad
;
perhap
we
can
also
classifi
men
as
a
horror
film

certainli
those

but
the

is
often
mesmer

and
the

is
a
work
of
fine
craftsmanship
,
which
make
it
well
worth

like
all

it
offer
a
myriad
of
parallel
to

while
watch
chad

i
could
n't

think
that

have
felt

there

alien

is
the
onli
alien
film
i
have
seen
in

i
saw
it
when
i

13
year

i
must
admit
that
i
did
n't
like
it

of

i
wa
expect
alien
again

i
believ
thi
wa
my
fault

in
order
to
appreci
alien

,
you
need
to
see
alien
,
but
you
also
have
to
wipe
awai
all
the
expect
from
it
predecessor
.
jame
cameron
's
alien
wa
an
action
film
,
and
mani
peopl
consid
it
the
best
in
the
seri
.
i
am
among
that
group
,
but
alien
3
is
an
extrem
entertain
film
,
which
critic
have
bash
for
it
origin
.
mani
thought
the
final
chase
scene
went
on
for
too
long
,
and
mani
other
thought
that
the
film
wa
too
much
dialogu
and
not
enough
action
.
both
ar
untru
,
becaus
the
film
ha
quit
a
bit
of
action
,
and
the
dialogu
wa
essenti
and
well-written
.
as
for
the
chase
sequenc
,
it
wa
long
,
but
not
overli
long
,
creat
quit
a
bit
of
suspens
from
confus
.
perhap
watch
alien
3
on
video
help
.
on
the
big
screen
,
i
wa
overwhelm
by
someth
i
normal
did
n't
see
.
it
wa
a
veri
dark
film
,
and
the
languag
wa
extrem
harsh
.
i
had
alwai
figur
the
alien
seri
to
reli
on
smart
dialogu
instead
of
moron
profan
.
do
n't
get
me
wrong
--
i
'm
not
sai
film
should
elimin
swear
,
but
when
a
film
substitut
dialogu
with
these
profan
remark
,
it
get
rather
distract
.
howev
,
sinc
see
it
again
,
i
realiz
that
the
swear
is
mainli
just
an
aspect
of
the
restrain
hatr
in
the
charact
.
as
a
result
,
alien
3
's
onli
flaw
(
albeit
a
major
on
)
is
the
underdevelop
charact
.
we
never
realli
care
about
ani
of
them
,
and
i
get
the
feel
that
mani
scene
were
cut
in
order
to
shorten
the
length
of
the
movi

there
were
onli
two
charact
i

becaus

the

where

the

it
's
quit
a
remark
open
,

on
which
will
remain
in
my
mind
for
a
long

becaus
of
thi

ha

the

on

riplei
is
discov
by
some
of
the
inmat

taken
back
to
the
refineri

of
cours
,
you
need
a
carrier
for
thi
face-hugger
,
and
it
attach
itself
to
the
dog
which
came
with
the
team
of

riplei

,
riplei
ask
to
see
the
dead

and
then
have
them
cremat

thi
cremat
scene
is
on
of

most
power

critic
fincher

of
the
death
scene
of

i
reveal
noth
by

thi

as
look
too
fake
,
but
i
enjoi

relish
in
the
portray

show
riplei
fall
in

is
a
nice
touch
,
but
by
actual
not
show
her
hit

,
a
great
deal
of

is
deriv

i
feel
that
it
would
have
spoil
the
mood
of

if
thei
had

howev

most
peopl
seem
to
want
to

which
creat
a
paradox

as
she
is

.
why
she
is

is
on

the

the

it

the
showdown
between
alien
and
riplei

machin
.
alien
3
ha
sever
,
but
most
memor
is
the
terrif
shot
involv
the
alien
and
riplei
.
riplei
is
push
up
against
a
wall
,
and
the
alien
stand
inch
awai
from
her
.
why
it
doe
n't
kill
her
is
a
shocker
,
which
later
lead
to
a
surpris
end
.
fincher

love
to
us
close-up
of
actor
'
face
(
michael
dougla
and
the
clown
face-off
in
the
game
in
the
same
style
)
,
and
by
shave
off
the
actor
'
hair
,
the
onli
thing
we
have
to
look
at
is
their
face
.
mani
critic
did
n't
like
all
the
actor
be
bald
,
but
it
make
complet
sens
when
taken
in
context
of
the
plot
.
most
of
alien
3
work
when
you
take
it
in
context
of
the
stori
,
but
when
you
try
to
compar
it
to
it
predecessor
,
fincher
's
turn
seem
a
bit
gloomi
and
dark
,
though
that
's
not
alwai
a
bad
thing
.
the
plot
is
pretti
much
a
rehash
of
the
first
two
film
,
with
some
major
twist
.
again
,
we
ar
setup
with
sever
differ
charact
,
and
on
by
on
,
thei
ar
pick
off
.
howev
,
while
the
first
two
had
ton
of
arsen
(
especi
cameron
's
film
)
,
alien
3
take
place
on
a
planet
devoid
of
human
life
except
for
thi
run-down
prison
.
as
a
result
,
no
weapon
ar
to
be
found
.
thi
creat
a
lot
of
tension
,
although
i
must
admit
that
fincher
could
have
ad
a
lot
more
suspens
.
as
an
alien
film
,
alien
3
is
the
worst
of
the
seri
,
but
by
itself
,
it
is
an
extrem
well-made
motion
pictur
,
with
a
lot
more
merit
than
not
.
the
unfortun
thing
surround
thi
second
sequel
is
the
on-dimension
charact
.
i
never
wa
realli
emotion
involv
on
screen
becaus
most
of
the
charact
ar
hardcor
crimin
whom
i
realli
could
care
less
about
.
despit
thi
,
riplei
wa
the
central
figur
,
and
that
's
what
is
import
.
we
care
for
her
,
even
though
she
began
to
act
just
like
on
of
the
gui
.
again
,
the
technic
side
of
thi
film
is
remark
,
and
better
than
the
two
previou
version
.
while
cameron
's
version
wa
a
pump
up
action
film
with
massiv
artillari
,
fincher
us
brilliant
camera
angl
,
terrif
light
,
and
moodi
set
.
the
cinematographi
,
by
alex
thomson
,
is
veri
well
done
,
with
a
terrif
chase
sequenc
toward
the
end
of
the
movi
.
the
confus
of
the
end
draw
the
viewer
in
,
as
we
ar
just
as
confus
as
the
actor
who
ar
be
chase
around
.
the
yellow
,
red
,
and
orang
of
the
light
creat
a
dark
mood
,
and
by
themselv
creat
a
lot
of

the
alien

it
predecessor
thi
time
around
,
and
the
swift
of
thi
alien
is
quit
intens
.
the
camera
like
to
take
up
the
perspect
of

alien

the

the
set
ar
quit

which
ar
reminisci
of
the
nostromo
from
alien
.
the

and
when

everyon
thought
it

thei

also
,
there
's

the
depriv/appreci
cycl
is
a
major
theme
of
american
beauti
.
american
beauti
is
a
non-formula
,
intellig
and
articul
movi
that
offer
fantast
perform
by
everyon
in
the
cast
,
especi
kevin
spacei
,
who
is
simpli
gosh
darn
amaz
thi
movi
.
the
thing
i
like
about
american
beauti
is
that
there
is
no
sentiment
music
,
no
hospit
scene
nor
ani
overli
dramat
hokum
.
the
movi
entertain
and
offer
brilliant
perform
just
as
is
.
if
you
ar
in
the
mood
for
a
thought
,
non-formula
flick
,
i
highli
recommend
american
beauti
.
though
it
is
a
fine
piec
of
filmmak
,
there
's
someth
about
elizabeth
.
.
.
that
left
me
a
bit
cold
,
and
i
think
it
is
someth
that
bug
me
quit
often
in
film
,
particularli
these
dai
;
i
just
did
n't
care
about
the
charact
.
to
me
,
the
first
and
foremost
job
of
a
filmmak
is
to
creat
charact
(
be
thei
imagin
or
histor
as
the
case
mai
be
)
that
the
audienc
give
a
hoot
about
.
and
though
elizabeth
work
well
on
mani
level
,
it
fall
short
of
excel
becaus
of
that
veri
reason
.
elizabeth
take
place
in
england
in
1554
,
as
queen
mari
,
half
sister
of
elizabeth
and
a
monarch
on
the
side
of
catholic
is
dy
.
befor
she
di
,
though
,
she
can
not
bear
to
sign
a
document
which
would
condemn
her
half
sister
to
death
becaus
of
her
heret
protest
belief
.
as
a
result
,
amidst
much
anger
within
the
council
,
elizabeth
becom
the
queen
of
england
.
the
film
chronicl
her
rise
to
power
as
she
fight
for
a
unifi
church
of
england
and
tri
to
bring
order
to
her
person
and
polit
life
.
much
of
the
film
deal
with
elizabeth
's
love
for
lord
robert
,
a
mysteri
man
who
thrust
hi
lordship
onto
mani
a
woman
as
he
continu
to
proclaim
hi
love
for
the
queen
.
there
is
much
ado
about
her
lack
of
a
husband
,
and
polit
pressur
from
spain
and
franc
enter
into
the
equat
.
the
problem
with
the
film
li
with
thi
as
it
centerpiec
,
as
love
interest
ar
such
a
charact
driven
element
.
i
did
n't
much
care
about
the
charact
(
perhap
asid
for
elizabeth
who
is
plai
quit
well
by
blanchett
)
and
so
i
did
n't
have
much
interest
in
who
would
join
her
in
her
nuptial
.
the
cast
is
round
out
well
with
the
marvel
rush
who
plai
the
queen
's
most
loyal
advisor
,
sir
franci
,
and
attenborough
as
a
well-mean
but
old-fashion
lead
council
.
why
then
,
you
must
be
ask
,
do
i
recommend
elizabeth
?
simpli
becaus
it
is
the
result
of
a
perfect
pair
of
director
and
cinematograph
.
kapur
and
hi

remi

,

of

decad

rank
with

watch
also
for

it
made
me
think
in

of
the
similar
between
the

thi

a

the

the

the

the

ar
perfect
for

add
a

the

(
the

ar

it

and
in
my
opinion
thi
film
achiev
an
entertain
level
in
film
that
is
so
terrif
,
it
mai
be
imposs
to
beat
.
with
the

there

hot
as
he

he
prove
it
for
me
all
right

but
the
reason
i
enjoi
thi

beyond
that
.
scream
tread
on

so
why
,
you
mai
ask
after
watch
it

becaus
it
treat
itself
as

and
thu
the
viewer
is
disilus
into
believ
that
it
is
not

familar

thi
rais
anoth
question
:
how
doe
it
do
thi
?
simpl
:
the

thei

not

and
that
make
it
scari
,
and
even
funni
at
certain
time

you
can
tell
thi
just
by
watch
the
open
scene
where
casei
becker
(
drew
barrymor
)
is
make
popcorn
,
get
readi
to

that

that
scene
work
becaus
in
a
normal
horror
film
,
half
the
thing
that
happen
in
that
scene
would
never

the
plot
is
typic

these

's
what
make

the

ar
slowli
re-drawn
to

again
,
and
thi
begin
to
complic
thing
.
the
polit
stori
is
noth
realli
special
but
work
in
itself
.
we
've
seen
it
mani
a
time
befor
,
but
it
's
at
least
interest
,
sometim
emot
,
and
even
rivet
at
time
.
there
's
a
big
riot
toward
the
middl
of
the
film
which
is
frighten
in
it
brutal
and
honesti
.
the
box
stori
is
veri
minor
to
the
stori
,
but
doe
repres
peopl
come
togeth
to
fight
eachoth
fairli
,

even
with
good

there
ar
onli
a

box
scene
,
but
thei
're
never
like
``
rage

/let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-it-bone
brilliant
.
thei
're
more
realist
,
and
instead
of
bone
crunch
,
we
hear
the
sound
of
the
glove
hit
eachoth
,
which
is
slightli
unerv
at
time
.
and
i
did
n't
know
daniel
dai-lewi
wa
in
such
good
shape
.
but
the
backbon
of
the
stori
is
the
love
on
.
becaus
these
charact
ar
given
such
horribl
circumst
,
and
sinc
the
two
lead
have
such
great
chemistri
togeth
,
we
realli
feel
for
their
plight
.
as
the
film
goe
on
,
and
circumst
get
wors
and
wors
,
the
charact
have
to
make
real
human
decis
,
and
we
can
sympath
with
them
as
human
not
charact
.
thi
is
how
you
write
a
love

take
note

these
element
ar
pretti
much
equal

with

of
the
part

i
love
how
each
of
the
differ
part
of
the
plot
matter
,
and
sometim
spill
over

it
made
sure
that
we
did
n't
just
care
for
on
of
them
.
i
'm
not

thei
're
all

great
,
becaus
the

at

thei

the

hi
wrong-do
.
how
can
you
expect
anyth
more
out
of
a
coupl
of
suburban
famili
ride
the
coattail
of
sexual
revolut
?
all
the
sex
and
drug
is
so
obvious
empti
,
and
i
think
that
's
the
point
of
the
film
.
at
first
view
,
the
entir
movi
might
seem
empti
,
but
then
why
should
n't
it
parallel
itself
?
you
do
n't
get
to
know
the
charact
veri
deepli
,
but
i
think
that
's
becaus
nobodi
in
the
movi
know
each
other
either
.
we
sadli
watch
two
famili
go
about
their
live
nearli
oblivi
to
on
anoth
.
at
first
glanc
,
you
might
think
emot
is
lost
in
the
end
scene
becaus
you
have
n't
gotten
to
know
the
charact
well
enough
to
sympath
-
then
you
realiz
that
just
might
be
the
point
,
and
then
you
do
feel
the
pain
.
the
act
by
all
is
quit
good
,
but
i
particularli
like
elijah
wood
.
he
doe
n't
seem
to
be
receiv
as
much
recognit
as
the
other
,
but
i
still
found
him
to
possess
quit
a
real
sens
of
be
.
christina
ricci
is
be
acclaim
for
her
part
as
the
misguid
teenag
temptress
who
look
for
someth
more
to
her
life
in
the
pant
of
everi

boi
.
still
,
i
sai
hat
off
remain
to
wood
,
joan
allen

subtl

believ
perform
as
a
lone
,
unappreci
wife
,
and
the
alwai
excel
kevin
kline
.
tobei
maguir
did
a
fine
job
,
but
hi
charact
which
,
perhap
,
wa
the
most
intact
,
sensibl
person
in
the
stori
,
seem
a
littl
lost
.
he
wa
need
,
but
perhap
he
should
've
been
us
more
.
the
ic
storm
is
be
hail
by
mani
as
on
of
the
best
film
of
the
year
.
i
hate
to
sai
that
i
do
n't
agre
,
but
i
do
n't
.
in
fact
,
i
can
think
of
mani
other
film
that
i
would
rank
higher
than
thi
on
.
even
so
,
it
is
a
veri
good
film
.
it
take
a
lot
of
retrospect
to
fulli
appreci
it
's
art
,
but
when
you
final
start
see
thing
in
it
that
you
did
n't
befor
,
you
start
to
grow
even
fonder
of
the
charact
and
the
stori
.
perhap
thi
is
on
to
see
,
ponder
,
and
then
watch
again
with
differ
ey
.
``

even

there
's
no

in

that

what
's
so
move
about
it
you
ask

the
tragedi

it

a

all

thi
is

the
complex
of

everyon

that
is
what
tear
us

back

it
wa
n't
onli

.
there
were
time
when
i
felt
it
too
be
a
littl
slow
,
but
most
romanc
ar
.
it
also
tend
to
be
a
bit
confus

especi
at
the
start

it
keep
jump
around
from

so
it
obvious
took
awhil
to
get
a
grasp
of

also
a
notabl

the
superb

thi

doe

,
as
some
critic
have
said
.
it
's
sweet
,

it
might
help
that
cameron
introduc
some
pretti

most
of

were
passeng
on

in

,
includ
the

)
,
the
captain
of
titan
(
bernard
hill
)
,
and
so
on
.
all
of
these
charact
add
an
extra
depth
to

make
it

easier

thing
realli
start
to
get

after
the
hour
and
a
half
mark
,
where
the
titan
strike
the
iceberg
and
begin
a
slow
sink
to
the
bottom
.
the
sink
is

realisticli

and
the
effect
ar
truli

it
is
not

the
best
part
of
the
movi
,
in
my
opinion
,
come
at
the
veri
end
,
when
we
flash
back
to
the

the

who
at

ar

rose
goe
out
onto

and
we
then
learn
a
secret
about
her
that
catch
us
off

we
then
see
a
dream
of
rose
's
,
in
which
she
return
to
the
titan

is
danc
with
jack
dawson

most
peopl
i
talk
with
after

saw
thi
as
onli
a

howev
,
i

it

i

it
meant

is
go
to
a
sort

would
be
the
happiest

thei

by

i
ca
n't

if
it
onli

that
good
in

the
aw

of

spew
forth
from
the
bowl
of
hollywood
so
far
thi
year
.
time
alon
will
make
that
call
.
but
by
the
end
of
the
film
we
were
all
on
truman
burbank
's
side
.
we
were
concern
for
hi
well-be
,
and
want
him
to
win
.
that
we
felt
as
we
did
is
a
tribut
both
to
the
film
and
to
jim
carrei
,
who
ha
achiev
legitimaci
at

the

is
a

in

which
look
like
michael

's
idea
of
the
perfect

truman
would
seem
to
live
the
perfect
middl

,
complet
with
a
work
wife
,
a
best
bud
,
friendli

and

there
is
tragedi
in
hi
past
-
hi
father
drown
in
a
horribl
boat
accid
,
leav
truman
with
a
dread
fear
of
water
,
and
of
travel
in

-
but
overal
,
life
is
good
.
but
then
on
dai
as
truman
leav
hi
hous
for
work
,
a
klieg
light
fall
magic
from

.
thi
curiou
event
mai
lead
truman
to
discov
what
the
rest
of
the
world
alreadi
know
:
that
he
is
a

on

's
biggest

,
that
hi

for

what

the

of

so
enjoy
to
watch
is
the
magic

so
that
we
can
make

let
me
tell
you
about
the
movi
itself
.
``
the
celluloid
closet
``
is
a
documentari
about
how
homosexu
ha
been
portrai
in
the
movi
over
the
past
sever
decad
.
it
's
brilliant
,
funni
,
naughti
and
extrem
poignant
.
it
tore
at
my
heart
to
watch
a
gift
lesbian
screenwrit
explain
that
,
as
a
rule
,
gai
audienc
hunger
for
ani
hint
of
homosexu
on
screen
.
regardless
of
how
veil
-
or
how
sordid
-
the
presenc
of
a
gai
or
lesbian
person
allow
other
to
lessen
their
sens
of
isol
and
make
them
feel
as
if
thei
're
not
quit
so
invis
as
america
seem
to
want
them
to
be
.
the
movi
itself
is
rate
r
-
and
for
good
reason
.
it
contain
scene
of
bloodi
,
violent
gai
bash
and
graphic
,
uninhibit
,
sex
.
as
with
ani
movi
,
i
appreci
know
about
these
thing
ahead
of
time
,
so
i
can
decid
for
myself
whether
to
see
the
movi
with
a
friend
,
a
date
,
my
11
year
old
niec
,
alon
or
not
at
all
.
but
,
that
's
the
movi
.
now
back
to
the

prior
to

when

a

at

gosh
,
i
certainli
do
n't
mean
to

``

.
i
would
,
howev
,
like
to
suggest
that
it
's
thei
who
ar
in
the

on
thi

and
the

ai
n't

'll
give
you

,
none
of
thi
wa

the
point
of
the

wa
that
homosexu
,
even
in
the
polit
correct
90s
,
is
ridicul
perceiv
as
a
threat
to
a
mostli
heterosexu
societi
.
a
point
well
made
in
thi
candid
and
honest
film
.
now
,
i
could
go
off
on
the
mpaa
's
rule
that
a
trailer
must
contain
``
no
homosexu
or
lesbian
``
and
ask
how
that
is
defin
,
particularli
in
light
of
some
of
the
thing
,
both
sexual
and
non-sexual
,
that
i
've
watch

do
in

.
i
just
do
n't
feel
the
need
to
go
there
,
becaus
it
seem
so
obviou
.
i
'll
instead
suggest
that
the

re-evalu
their
evalu

.
let
the

reflect
not

like
``

let

in

i

charact

the
same
voic
,
the
same
everyth
from
the
show
and
that
's
what
make
it
good
.
you
might
think
with
a
movi
from
a
tv
show
,
you
can
chang
a
few
thing
.
often
time
thi
spell
disast
for
film
becaus
the
film
maker
veer
awai
from
what
made
the
show
popular
in
the
first
place
!
take
a
few
tip
from
the
pulp
fiction
school
of
filmmak
,
go
is
the
new
featur
from
the
director
of
the
cult
hit
swinger
.
the
stori
centr
around
a
group
of
peopl
,
who
includ
brit
simon
(
askew
)
,
and
checkout
girl
clair
(
holm
)
and
ronna
(
pollei
)
and
the
misadventur
that
thei
get
into
,
split
into
three
chapter
.
everyth
from
sex
to
drug
to
violenc
is
cover
in
a
film
with
a
much
blacker
edg
in
comedi
than
swinger
.
although
qt
's
touch
is
evid
in
nearli
everi
frame
,
go
is
entertain
enough
to
forget
about
the
similar
and
just
enjoi
the
rollercoast
ride
.
liman
,
who
also
photograph
the
film
,
ha
a
deft
touch
with
the
camera
,
and
the
film
look
good
.
the
film
also
seem
to
have
benefit
from
a
budget
,
with
the
night-club
scene
in
particular
look
pretti
good
.
there
's
a
twist
sens
of
humour
run
throughout
which
ensur
that
even
the
darkest
scene
get
a
smirk
.
the
young
cast
ar
talent
and
help
bring
the
stori
to
life
.
holm

on
of
the
dawson

cast
(
a
show
i
'm
not

displai
much
talent
here
,
and
despit

to
make
a
three

charact

never
becom
a

.
askew
is
slightli
success
,
be
rather
obnoxi
.
no
doubt
the
filmmak
intend
thi
to
make
the
audienc
cheer
when
what
happen
to
him
,
but
instead
of
'funni
annoi
'
he
's
just
annoi
.
he
drag
down
slightli
on
of
the
funniest
chapter
,
but
the
talent
around
him
in
that
particular
tale
more
than
make
up
for
it
.
the
real
standout
is
sarah
pollei
as
the
drug
deal
checkout
girl
:
her
refresh
and
deepli
enjoy
perform
make
the
heavi
go
stori
she
is
involv
in
much
more
entertain
.
also
entertain
timothi
olyph
as
the
rather
sinist
drug
dealer
,
who
give
an
nice
evil
perform
.
the
script
,
written
john
august
,
is
sharp
and
witti
,
with
good
dialogu
and
some
funni
joke
.
it
start
off
rather
slow
howev
,
but
in
about
twenti
minut
the
script
ha
found
it
's
foot
and
just
keep
get
better
.
the
stori
ar
larg
satisfi
,
although
occasion
there
's
too
much
attent
on
on
detail
but
not
on
anoth
.
also
,
some
of
the
end
seem
a
littl
forc
and
lucki
.
still
,
the
cast
have
a
meati
script
to
get
into
and
obvious
enjoi
it
.
it
could
of
tri
a
littl
harder
in
some
part
howev
,
and
these
part
lag
.
becaus
thi
is
a
gen-xer
movi
,
the
obligatori
rave
soundtrack
must
accompani
,
and
go
's
on
is
pretti
decent
.
unlik
other
gen-xer
movi
,
go
never
allow
the
music
to
substitut
for
plot
or
dialogu
,
which
is
a
plu

go
is
a
veri
easi
movi

and
the
audienc

not

as

it

becaus
for

it

it

,

the

i
suppos
the
strength

lie
within
the
central
trio
:

the

accuraci
.
all
of
thi

not

`sleepi

is
a
lavish

frighten

if

gallop
off

ok
,
i
admit
i
had
a
bad
attitud
about
thi
film
from
the
start
.
a
romant
comedi
about
the
trial
and
tribul
of
singl
work
parent
?
with
a
coupl
of
incred
cute

thrown

yuck
.
but
it
's
not
realli
too
bad
.
it
ha
a
lot
work
against
it
,
for
me
at
least
.
in
addit
to
the
abov
,
it
is
typic
of
a
lot
of
recent
movi
in
that
it
is
realli
just
a
glorifi
made-for-tv
movi
,
but
longer
and
with
bigger
star
,
and
you
have
to
pai
to
see
it
.
it
doe
win
you
over
,
though
,
even
if
it
is
painfulli
predict
.
just
think
about
it
:
two
singl
parent
,
with
their
cute
kid
,
ar
thrown
togeth
due
to
a
miss
field
trip
.
through
a
dai
of
near
disast
,
thei
cont
inual
meet
,
get
in

anoth
's

,
caus
troubl
for
on
anoth
,
and
gener
insult
on
anoth
at
everi
opportun
.
in
fact
,
thei
hate
each
other
so
much
that
we
know
that
thei
ar
,
or
soon
will
be
,
in
love
.
the
onli
peopl
who
hate
each
other
more
than
lover
ar
marri
coupl
.
so
thi
film
is
predict
,
just
as
the
screwbal
comedi
of
the
classic
hollywood
cinema
were
predict
(
and
the
screwbal
genr
is
obvious
hoffman
's
model
for
thi
film
)
.
will
thei
get
fire
from
their
yuppi
job
?
will
thei
make
the
big
soccer
game
that
is
so
import
to
their

will
pfeiffer
realiz
what
a

,
a

realli
is
(
ar
n't
thei
all
?
)
?
will
thei
final

?
well
,
what
do
you
expect
?
but
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
satisfact
in
have
our
expect
fulfil
,
especi
when
it
is
done
with
as
much

,
along
with
a
lack

,
as
it
is
in

.
pfeiffer
and
cloonei
have
a
certain
chemistri
togeth
that
is

charm
,
and
the
kid
ar
neither

the
first
thing
thi

first

let
me
assur
you
that
no

is
requir
to
fulli
enjoi
thi

.
the
produc
ar
not
stupid
,
make
a
movi
just
for
fan
of
the

is
not
profit
.
you
have
to
reach
for
a
larger
audienc

therefor
,
the
movi
is
quit
user-friendli
.
altough
,
non-fan
will
onli
fail
to
understand
certain
emot
behind
the
look
mani
charact
exchang

but
fear
not
,
duchovni
and
anoth
man
later
on
provid
more
than
adequ

go
on

you
will
never
feel
as
if
you
just
walk
in
on
the
third
act
of
some
great
opera
.
in
ani
case
,
the
answer
is
no
.
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
x-file
,
i
onli
watch
it
when
noth
els
is

i
prefer

i
am
glad
to
report
that
i
learn
noth

everyth
you
need
to
know
is
explain
to
the
viewer
by
duchovni
and
other
.
i
know
i
am
go
mayb
a
bit
too
far
to
make

point

what
that
weird
``

is
all
about

you
have
been
warn

the
x-file
is
what
a
summer
should
be

excit

scari

great
special

(
unlik
other
summer
movi
the
effect
do
not
take
over
the
movi
and
ar
onli
there
when
it
is
realli
necessari
)
and
good
perform
.
thi
is
come
from
a
gui
who
think
david
duchovni
is
the
human
equival
of
a
wooden
plank
.
from
start
to
finish
,
thi
movi
doe
not
let
go
of
you
.
when
i
compar
it
with
last
summer
's
movi
the
best
wai
to
describ
it
would
be
:
take
the
excit
and
great
score
from
face/off
and
the
deadli
us
of
sound
from
event
horizon
.
thi
flick
is
scari
,
not
in
a
b
movi
kind
of
wai
where
you
alwai
know
where
and
when
the
critter
will
jump
at
our
hero
.
in
fact
,
the
first
time
the
critter
in
thi
movi
make
an
apper
it
is
total
out
of
the
blue
.
you
might
as
well
bring
ear
plug
becaus
thi
thing
is
louuuudd
!
the
last
time
a
monster
scare
me
that
much
wa
when
i
first
saw
alien
as
a
six
year
old
kid
.
you
know
,
when
you
ar
affraid
to
put
you
feet
on
the
floor
becaus
the
creatur
might
be
under
the
chair
,
or
when
you
keep
try
to
cover
your
throat
with
your
shirt
?
so
yeah
,
the
x-file
is
scari
.
and
guess
what
?
you
never
even
have
to
see
the
monster
but
your
imagin
work
overtim
and
it
sure
beat
have
to
watch
a
flaw
,
comput
gener
,
babyzilla
,
it
look
like
you
could
walk
right
through
it
not
even
scarier
than
your
grandma
in
undi
type
of
monster
.
do
not
think
that
the
x-file
is
a
monster
movi
.
in
fact
,
the
creatur
is
there
for
mayb
three
minut
total
.
no
,
the
x-file
is
defin
a
mulder
episod
of
the

.
sculli
is

,
but
gillian
anderson
get
mayb
half
the
screen
time
.
she
ha
a
coupl
of
good
scene
with
duchovni
,
but
she
get
kidnap
dure
the
last
half
hour
of
the
movi
so
she
doe
not
get
to
do
much
.
no
,
thi
is
mulder
's
time
in
the
spotlight
.
by
now
,
you
have
heard
of
the
scene
where

if

not
then
i
will
not
spoil
it
for
you
,
let
's
just
sai
that
due

so
what
ar
you
complain
about
?
the
dialogu
in
interest
and
the
director
is
marvel
.
the
camera
is
almost
alwai
look
over
the
shoulder
of
our
hero
so
we
feel
as
if
we
ar
right
there
with
them
when
thei
open
a
door
or
climb
a
hill
.
the
script
is
spotless

if

can
not

out

again

not

structur

plai
like

with

more
plot

while
we
see
sever
extrem
taboo

we
also
have
a
skimpi
littl
plot
go
on
(
mostli
toward

,
and
mayb
just
a
hair
of
character

not

the

is
gener
pretti
good
,
and
we
do
n't
realli
see
a
lot
of

expos

what
make
it
suprem
differ
from

the
fact
that
thi

you
would
n't
think
there
would
be
mani
peopl
who
share
thi

kind
of
fetish

thei
run

and
hi
crutch-carri

ar
also
into

vaughan
is
into

on

as
thei
ar
,
but
he
take
it
to
anoth
level
:
he
love
to
recreat
famou

in
on

,
he
and
a

,
colin

recreat
jame
dean

car
crash
without
ani
pad

,
and
suffer
some
concuss
,
but
nevertheless
get
a
rush
(
and
the
attent
of
the
polic
)
.
soon
,
these
five
ar
all
have
sex
with
on
anoth
,
be
it
straight
,
gai
,
or
lesbian
sex
.
while
thi
is
admittingli
all
a
bit
comic
(
the
film
is
almost
like
a
black
comedi
)
,
the
film
doe
do
a
pretti
awesom
portray
of
peopl
who
's
main
fetish
is
live
on
the
edg
.
i
'm
sure
somewher
there
ar
peopl
who
get
arous
by
car
accid
,
but
i
person
do
n't
see
a
connect
between
car
crash
and
sex
.
the
main
connect
cronenberg
show
us
that
both
give
a
definit
rush
.
hi
car
crash
scene
ar
quick
and
excit
mini-masterpiec
:
we
're
at
first
not
sure
if
thei
'll
take
place
,
but
everytim
it
look
like
it
mai
occur
,
we
gasp
.
then
when
it
happen
,
we
hold
our
breath
.
the
same
thing
happen
with
sex
,
although
not
in
the
same
fashion
.
these
peopl
ar
mere
take
it
to
anoth
level
.
the
onli
problem
with
the
film
is
that
it
's
a
tad
redund
.
a
normal
porn
last
from
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
a
half
.
thi
goe
on
for
about
100
minut
,
and
it
just
seem
a
littl
too
long
.
the
sex
and
car
crash
ar
far
between
on
anoth
,
and
the
time
between
them
ar
a
tad
on
the
bore
side
.
there
's
no
character
,
although
it
could
definit
be
argu
,
that
hei
,
it
's
a
porn
,
and
we
're
not
here
to
sympath
.
but
still
,
thei
coulda
cut
it
down
a
bit
.
but
the
film
is
save
with
it
present
,
as
well
as
some
other
element
.
the
atmospher
is
veri
dark
and
forbod
,
creat
a
kind
of
cool
weird
feel
.
and
there
ar
sever
scene
ar
just
amaz

on

ha
catherin
and
jame
have
sex
,
while
she
softli
ask
him
question
about
be
with
a
man
,
which
sound
almost
erot
the
wai
she
sai
it
.
a
sequenc
involv
on
charact
's
death
is
fill
with
all
the
edgi
disjoint
that
the
film
need
.
and
the
final
shot
is
shot
perfectli
,
creat
an
imag
of
a
car
crash
,
and
a
coupl
have
sex
in

of
it

despit
the
fact
that
she
's
wound

the
act
is
also
pretti
good

especi
for
what
is
almost
a

,
a
far
cry
from
the
qualiti

of

younger
dai
such
as

.
but
hi
perform
here
as
an
alien
in

is
noth
short
of
outstand
.
the
weird

bizarr

the

hilari

tragic

thi
is
a
tour-de-forc

quit
simpli
the
best

the
balanc

just
about

even
if

in
fact
my
onli
critic
of
the
film
is
that
thing
get
a
tad
weak
toward
the
end
.
tighter
direct
could
have
given
the
climax
more
urgenc
and
a
few
of
the

rather
illog
given
their
life-threaten

you
do

it

the

ai

i
wa

anyon
who

by

i

who
wholli
succe
in
rise
abov
the
often
poor
dialogu
,
and
the
bond
thei
form
is
both
heartfelt
and
move
.
it
's
an
old
stori
,
you
know
--
forbidden
love
ala
romeo
and
juliet
--
but
it
work
,
and
jack
's
``
rescu
``
rose
(
in
both
liter
and
figur
sens
)
and
teach
her
to
live
life
for
what
count
wa
point
and
touch
.
in
fact
,
i
enjoi
the
first
half
of
the
film
a
lot
,
larg
becaus
winslet
and
dicaprio
bring
such
and
charm
,
energi
to
the
romanc
.
it
's
engag
,
touch
and
veri
enjoy
.
there
's
more
than
a
ting
of
poignanc
to
it
as
well
,
simpli
becaus
you
know
it
's
not
go
to
be
a
happi
end
.
which
lead
us
to
the
second
half
of
the
film
.
we
all
knew
it
wa
come
.
i
'm
sure
director
cameron
wa
look
forward
with
eager
anticip
to
it
,
becaus
as
he
's
state
in
interview
,
the
real
thrust
of
the
stori
(
for
him
)
wa
the
sink
,
and
the
jack/rose
romanc
wa
a
mere
a
manipul
plot
devic
to
get
you
emotion
into
the
film
.
i
think
that
underst
the
import
of
the
romanc
,
as
i
found
it
far
more
enjoy
than
an
hour
of
watch
peopl
die
.
the
iceberg
arriv
,
and
the
captain
announc
that
titan
will
have
sunk
in
about
an
hour
.
and
it
is
an
hour
.
my
good
,
we
do
n't
miss
a
second
of
that
hour
?
gratuit
?
well
,
perhap
not
by
todai
's
standard
,
i
'm
sure
there
's
been
far
wors
produc
under
the
banner
of
``
entertain
``
in
other
film
.
but
i
certainli
wa
n't
prepar
for
how
shock
and
graphic
the
last
hour
or
so
would
be
.
not
that
i
'd
expect
the
word
``
understat
``
to
be
part
of
cameron
's
vocabulari
(
he
who
brought
us
such
,
umm
,
vivid
film
as
``
termin
2
``
and
``
alien
``
)
.
is
it
overdon
?
i
thought
so
.
understat
can
sometim
work
wonder
in
convei
tragedi
.
no
,
no
on
expect
a
happi
end
,
but
i
did
n't
quit
expect
the
horrend
shock
and
power
scene
we
were
bombard
throughout
the
film
's
second
half
.
still
,
whether
it
wa
overdon
and
heavi-hand
or
not
,
if
it
wa
the
shock-factor
cameron
wa
after
it
work
,
becaus
i
wa
shock
and
move
,
in
fact
i
spent
most
of
the
last
hour
in
tear
!
you
realli
could
n't
help
but
get
emotion
involv
,
whether
it
wa
wish
someon
would
knock
that
dreadfulli
psychot
fianc
of
rose
's
overboard
or
desper
hope
that
rose
would
rescu
jack
,
or
that
jack
would
rescu
rose
,
or
that
thei
would
both
surviv
.
perhap
the
most
harrow
scene
wa
when
the
ship
ha
sunk
,
and
those
that
sunk
along
with
the
ship
freez
to
death
on
the
water
surfac
.
the
bit
where
rose
let
go
of
jack
's
hand
,
while
promis
she
'll
never
let
go
in
her
heart
wa
particularli
heart-wrench
,
and
the
sight
of
rescu
boat
sail
amid
the
ocean
of
corps
wa
a
pretti
power
imag
,
to
put
no
fine
a
point
on
it
.
i
love
the
end
,
howev
,
which
wa
both
move
and
slightli
uplift
follow
the
horror
of
the
past
hour
and
a
half
.
so
,
we
've
establish
that
the
film
is
power
and
move
,
if
the
last
hour
wa
rather
excess
.
have
n't
mention
the
script
.
plot-wise
it
's
ok
,
though
the
jack/rose
relationship
wa
beautifulli
develop
,
but
i
've
a
feel
that
's
to
the
actor
credit
if
anyth
.
as
for
the
dialogu
?
well
,
titan
is
set
in
1912
.
it
's
a
period
drama
.
but
i
saw
veri
littl
indic
of
period
in
so
far
as
the
dialogu
is
concern
.
did
thei
realli
us
phrase
like
``
goddamn
it
!
``
back
in
the
turn
of
the
centuri
?
i
doubt
it
.
would
someon
talk
like
thi
:
``
do
ya
love
the
gui
or
what
?
``
.
i
doubt
it
.
is
such
dialogu
as
``
i
saw
the
iceberg
,
and
i
see
it
in
your
ey
now
``
not
just
a
bit
?
clumsi
?
ye
it
is
.
a
littl
more
attent
to

would
not
have
gone

,
and
cameron
himself
is
to
blame
(
he
wrote
the

)
.
stick
with

but
it
more
than
redeem

and
as
for

thei

well
i
guess
that
's
typic

for
you

in

,
rush

the

some

allow

the
onli

that
's
a

``
the

he
co-wrote

the

thi

wa
obvious
gear
toward

have
said
that
,
i
enjoi
the
look

of

,
thought
jame

gave
a
solid
perform
,
love
the

,
and
yup
,
love
that
t

!
i
actual
thought
thi
wa
a
comedi
go
in
,
but
overal
,
it
plai
more
toward
the
dramat
,
than
a

.
i
also
enjoi
jon
voight
's
perform
as
the
stubborn
dick
coach
,
as
well
as
mani
of
the
other
charact
player
on
the
team
.
thi
is
not
a
classic
film
by
ani
stretch
of
the
imagin
,
but
it
might
teach
some
kid
the
hard
lesson
behind
the
``
fun
``
game
of
footbal
,
or
just
allow
them
to
have
a
good

for
about
an

if

review
by
brandon
her
octob
7
,
1999
.
i
have
to
admit
that
i
dislik
thi
film
initi
.
it
certianli
is
n't
for
everi
tast
,
and
it
's
sheer
tortur
to
sit
through
if
you
're
in
a
restless
mood
.
that
said
,
if
you
ar
in
the
right
mood
,
it
's
absolut
incred
.
thi
wa
my
second
favorit
movi
of
1998
,
and
would
have
been
a
shoo-in
for
first
in
almost
ani
other
year
.
perhap
the
big
turn-off
for
mani
wa
thi
film
's
unconvention
.
i
'd
be
hard-press
to
compar
it
to
ani
other
film
that
i
've
seen
-
it
is
veri
,
veri
artsi
,
incred
slow
-
and
amazingli
,
it
work
beautifulli
.
on
my
second
view
,
i
realiz
that
the
film
follow
the
three
act
structur
(
i
did
n't
think
it
had
ani
sort
of
structur
at
all
when
i
first
saw
it
)
.
the
first
act
serv
to
set
up
the
charact
-
sort
of
.
it
exist
even
moreso
to
set
a
mood
of
tension
and
restles
,
and
perhap
even
feel
of
boredom
.
and
then
it
is
shatter
by
the
intens
violenc
of
the
second
(
which
encompass
most
of
the
movi
)
.
the
major
of
the
film
is
on
extend
battl
scene
,
intercut
with
brief
flashback
and
voic-over
.
the
artsier
element
do
not
detract
from
the
action
,
but
add
to
it
-
thei
succe
in
briefli
let
the
viewer
peek
into
the
mind
of
the
soldier
,
onli
to
be
suddenli
yank
back
into
realiti
when
the
battl
resum
.
the
battl
scene
ar
amaz
(
second
onli
to
``
save
privat
ryan
``
in
my
opinion
)
.
thei
're
brutal
,
horrifi
,
and
at
time
beauti
due
to
the
amaz
cinematographi
.
the
second
act
is
as
immers
,
brilliant
,
and
haunt
as
ani
film
that
i
have
ever
seen
.
the
onli
problem
come
dure
the
first
and
third
act
.
malick
take
a
littl
too
long
to
get
the
film
start
.
although
the
initi
scene
-
which
consist
of
two
soldier
'
experienc
a
near-eden-like
paradis
while
go
awol
,
and
the
preper
for
battl
-
ar
effect
and
necessari
,
hint
of
pretenti
sink
in
.
the
film
is
just
a
tad
too
artsi
near
the
begin
,
and
a
lot
of
peopl
that
dislik
the
movi
probabl
gave
up
on
it
becaus
of
thi
.
the
final
act
is
effect
at
wind
the
film
down
,
but
the
problem
from
the
first
persist
-
it
's
a
bit
too
long
,
and
come
over
as
pretenti
at
time
.
that
said
,
there
ar
two
sequenc
(
on
where
a
soldier
get
a
devast
note
from
hi
wife
,
and
anoth
where
on
of
the
main
charact
is
kill
)
that
ar
noth
short
of
incred
.
the
perform
ar
phenomin
all
around
.
the
two
standout
ar
nick
nolt
and
newcom
jim
caviezel
,
both
of
whom
should
have
been
nomin
for
oscar
.
nolt
is
rivet
and
intens
as
the
colonel
in
charg
of
the
oper
.
hi
charact
is
hard
,
mean
,
and
somewhat
reckless
with
the
live
of
hi
men
,
and
yet
nolt
somehow
manag
to
evok
sympathi
for
him
.
caviezel
is
forev
question
the
natur
of
war
,
hi
place
in
it
,
and
if
there
's
ani
deeper
mean
to
the
hell
that
he
's
go
through
.
he
is
absolut
perfect
-
genuin
,
sympathet
,
sincer
,
and
yet
strong
when
he
need
to
be
.
although
restrict
to
a
rel
small
role
,
sean
penn
is
also
veri
good
as
the
compani
's
pessimist
seargent
.
as
to
how
it
stack
up
to
``
save
privat
ryan
``
-
it
wa
my
second
favorit
movi
of
1998
,
``
ryan
``
wa
my
first
.
it
's
realli
hard
to
compar
the
two
-
thei
ar
so
,
so
differ
-
so
i
wo
n't
,
beyond
sai
that
spielberg
's
film
had
more
of
an
impact
on
me
.
howev
,
the
two
ar
compar
from
the
standpoint
of
qualiti
(
i
can
easili
see
why
someon
would
``

.
i
highli
recommend
both
of

all
in

,
``
the

is

of

it

the
big
question
about
thi

is
:
why
?
i

it

an
attempt

it

i

i
wa
under

i
feel
that

wa

it
seem

though
i
still
give
it
a
posit

starship

,
on

ha

sens

,
know
perfectli
well
how
ridicul
it
mai
seem

as
a
result
,
starship

is
a
more
excit

energet

and
live
scienc

film
.
in
fact
,
i
probabl
could
never
get
tire
of
watch
thi
film
.
starship
trooper
is
veri
reminisci
of
star
war
,
anoth
kick-ass
space
opera
which
reinvent
the
sci-fi
drama
altogeth
.
while
starship
trooper
is
no
star
war
,
it
come
quit
close
,
and
the
easiest
assess
would
be
to
call
thi
film
:
``
the
'star
war
'
of
the
90s
.
``
am
i
be
to
gener
to
thi
film
?
perhap
,
but
when
a
scienc

film
come
along
that
can
mix
humor
and
romanc
,
effect
,
into
the
war
race
.
in
essenc
,
thi
is
the
scienc
fiction
equivol
of
pulp
fiction
.
the
easiest
wai
to
write
a
review
of
thi
film
would
be
to
compar
it
to
other
scienc
fiction
film
,
and
i
mai
have
to
.
starship
trooper
is
not
quit
an

despit

my
guess

that

:
awesom

never
in

life
have
i
seen
an
actor
as
insan
dedic
as
jacki

for
the
simpl
reason
that
he
ha
perform
hi
own
stunt
in
hi
everi
movi
he
's
ever
appear
in
,
he
should
be
award
greatli
.
the

tom
and

formula
that
wa
us
to
make

rumbl
in

supercop
so

can
be
found
here
as
well
.
howev
,
first
strike
wa
probabl
the
most
excit
out
of
the
three
,
for
the
simpl
reason
that
practic
make
perfect
.
hi
last
two
movi
were
almost
like
practic
and
thi
on
wa
great
.
like
rumbl
,
thi
film
is
about
the
mafia
,
the
former

.
now
chan
must
do
battl
in
the
freez
arctic
temperatur
of
the
ukrain
against
a
group
of
veri
larg
bad
men
.
the
trailer
for
the
film
sum
it
up
quit
well
.
first
strike
is
action-pack
,
but
the
fight
scene
ar
so
fast
and
furiou
,
thei
almost
have
a
witti
,
italian-like
humor
to
them
.
jacki
chan
is
a
regular
comedian
.
well
,
he
's
no
eddi
murphi
,
but
he
can
realli
crack
you
up
.
for
exampl
,
he
is
hang
off
a
roof
and
he
humor
taunt
hi
foe
to
come
and
get
him
,
as
he
claim
to
be
the
korean
007
(
that
's
secret

.
even
the
plot
to
thi

improv
abov
the

,
as
a
sort-of
twist
nuclear-weapon
smuggl
deal
is
botch
and
jacki
take
the
blame
.
but
never
fear
,
as
the
chines
mafia
aid
him
in
uncov
the
truth
behind
the
incid
.
with
some
of
the
most
high-fly
stunt
and
side-split
comedi
,
first
strike
is
a
sure-fire
hit
that
's
guarante
to
draw
some
major
,
world-wide
attent
.
,
as
a
devout
atheist
and
an
avow
believ
in
alien
,
i
have
some
idea
of
how
elli
arowai
(
jodi

feel
.
but
becaus
my
reason
for
not
partak
in
religion
ar
differ
than
her
,
i
ca
n't
sai
that
i
do
exactli
.
her
reason
is
that
she
need
solid
proof
:
there
is
no
proof
that
god
exist
,
so
therefor
she
doe
not
believ
.
elli
also
believ
in
alien
,
and
ha
spent
most
of
her
life
try
to
prove
thei
exist
.
how
can
she
sai
she
doe
n't
believ
in
god
becaus
of
the
lack
of
proof
,
and
then
sai
she
believ
in
alien
,
which
ar
gereal
less
believ
in
than
god
without
sound
like
a
hypocrit
?
that
's
the
catch-22
.
when
alien
from

thei

not

more
would
spoil
the
fun
of
jacki

,
and
that
's
the
biggest
reason
to
go
see
a
tarantino
film
.
tarantino
seem
to
have
a
fascin
with
hitmen
and
unusu

(
and
slang
term
)
,
but
thei
ar
alwai
done

hi

normal

thei
ar
rude
to

of
cours
,
thi
is
a
tarantino
film
,
and
you
know
you
can
expect
some
awkward
situat
to
aris
.
and
perhap
the
biggest
flaw
with
jacki
brown
is
the
slow
middl
section
in
which
the
pace
begin
to
drop
.
of

,

fix

and
then
from

and
then
from

thi
all
lead
up

which
decid
who
is
on
whose
side

on
the
technic
side
of
jacki
brown
,
quentin
tarantino
direct
it
with
the
same
style
as
he
did
with
hi
1994
film
.
howev
,
thi
time
around
it
is
n't
as
nearli
as

.
the
write
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
quit
good
,
although
i
do
find

us
of

the
stori
jump
back

in

as
in

it
's

easi
to

hi

a

jacki

is
veri
simpli
to
follow
,
especi
consid
that
the
time
is
given
dure
the
``

in

perhap
thi
is
a
result
of

the
cinematographi
is

well
done
by
guillermo

(
who
ha
work
with

on

and
the

is
veri
good

and
as
with
pulp
fiction
,
the
music
is
a
highlight
,
bring
back
memor
song
from
the
70s
and
80s
.
the
act

of

the

me

no

robert

the
best

as
he

most

he
is

of

he

for

and
some

as
a
film
by
itself
,
jacki

is
a
terrif
piec
of
entertain
,
with
a
complex
plot
to
draw
viewer
in
.
howev
,
on
can
not

compar
it

expect

perhap
the

with

to

contain

plan
for

it

a

that
will
allow
on

to
travel
to

of

the
big

becom
``

(
right

elli
board

through

even
though

for

her
stori
is

believ
by

there
is
a
lot
to
like
about

i

highlight
those
point
first
.
elli
arrowai
is
a
well-round
charact
portrai
by
on
of
the
best
actress
current
work

neither
the
charact
nor
the
perform
ha
the
same
depth
as
claric
starl
in
silenc
of

lamb
,
but
that
's
a
tough
standard
to

.
elli
is
interest
in
that
she

her

drumlin

hadden

ha

but
in
the
end
he
seem
to

noth

without

the

the

in

scene
ar
so
good
that
just
for
them
,
i
'd
almost
recommend
the

almost
.
but
what
i
realli
like
about
thi
film
is
despit
the
fact
that
it
's
a
mess
,
despit
the
fact
that
what
thi
film
realli
need
is
a
good
old
fashion
rewrit
by
allen
himself
,
it
's
still
a
smart
and
insight
film
.
though
some
of
the
joke
ar
either
stale
or
misplac
(
some
seem
too
cartoonish
,
even
for
thi
environ
)
,
allen
still
manag
to
get
across
that
thi

is
not
exactli
about

as
it
mai
seem
to
be
(
if
it
were
,
it
'd
be
extrem
out-of-touch
)
,
but
about
those
who
want
to
be
celebr
,
and
how
thei
equat
celebr-hood
with
happi
.
we
never
get
close
enough
to
the
actual
celebr
to
see
if
thei
're
realli
happi
(
thei
mai
appear
to
be
on
the
surfac
.
.
.
)
,
but
we
do
get
close
enough
to
lee
and
davi
'
charact
.
lee
is
obsess
with
the
phenomenon
,
while
davi
take
is
at

's
length
,
and
never
get
too
involv

it

soon
becom
on

besid
,
it
's
witti
,
and
it
doe
have
the
on
thing
that
no

ha

allen
's
:
that

that
these

the

ar
not

that
seem

the

seem
to
reli

no

the
act

becom

philosoph

the

when

thei
can
bare
stop

unfortun

a

most

try

avoid
it

onli
a

the
perform
ar
good
enough
to
make

maintain

a

the

on
ha
veri
littl

that

i
would

also
of

in

the
wai
the

the
anatomi

we

how
the

the

and
why
it
did
so
in

manner

these
technic
detail
serv
as

guid
for

the
look

to

that

even

ani
film
that

thi

of
thought
is
certainli
a
mileston
in

.
even
if
``

ha
some

(

it
still

the

is
so
believ
that
it
is
no

that

now

howev
,
the

david

ha
long
been
my
favorit
screenwrit
and
director
.
with
hi
distinct

more
often
than
not

and
hi
laid
back
style
of

nearli
all
of

ar
absolut
irresist

some
of
them
tend
to
be

decept

that
requir
the
audienc
to
look
at

in

the

is
slightli
more
conspicu

in

it

about

name
a
plai
by
terrenc
rattigan
,
set
in

he
cast
nigel
hawthorn
in
the
lead

as
arthur
winslow
,
a

ag
man
who
find
out
that

he

``
no

that
's
enough
for

who
,
with
hi
oldest

,
immedi
start
a
crusad
to
bring

thei
enlist
the
help
of
sir
robert
morton
,
a
notori
attornei
to
help
them
achiev
that
formid
daunt
task
.
it
all
seem
fairli
frivol
,
and
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
,
the
winslow
case
is
not
the
trial
of
the

but
arthur
is
determin
to
keep
hi
famili
's
word
clean
and
he
is
will
to
go

to
make

soon

,
sir

along
with
the

wrap
up
in
the
proceed
.
so
do
we
.
all
david
mamet
doe
for
the
script
is
tighten
and
hone
the
dialogu
,
but
hi
style
is
still
fairli
appar
.
the
charact
still
talk
in
hi
trademark
staccatto
line
and
there
is
still
tension
present
in
convers
that
no
ordinari
writer
would
be
abl
to
make
tens

but
thi
is
not
mamet
's
norm
,
and
it
's
refresh
to
see
mamet
deviat
from
hi
world
of
crook
,
gangster
as
con
men
,
wonder
as
those
film
were
.
nigel
hawthorn
's
perform
is
nearli
flawless
.
hi
deliveri
is
that
of
a
dignifi
yet
not
pompou
man
who
seem
to
be
get
beaten
at
hi
own

.
we
piti
the
man
,
but
we
also
like
him
.
rebecca
pidgeon
,
david
mamet
's
wife
,
who
gave
a
fairli
aw
perform
in
the
spanish
prison
is
at
the
top
of
her
game
here
as

up
for

the

is
a
wonder
movi
that
avoid

as

scene
and
shoot
higher
--
it

to

be

:
did
you
feel
anyth
profound
at

after
the
courtroom
scene
in

like
a
time
to

?
if
you

,
thi
is
a

it

david

can
churn
out

in
thi
movi
he
prove
to
those
who
ever
doubt
it

for

about
thi

describ
it
as
a
cross
between
the
silenc

the

while
it
doe
share
some

with
both

(
particularli
the

,
the

the

,
prove
that
singh
is
as
adept
at
film
strang
and
wonder
imag
as
hi
acclaim
would
lead
us
to
believ
.
the
first
sequenc
that
take
place
in
stargher
's
mind
is
by
far
the
best
,
featur
on
of
the
most
ingeni
trap
i
've
ever
seen
in
a
film
(
involv
a
hors
,
which
no
on
see
thi
film
will
probabl
forget
)
,
a
zoo-like
displai
of
stargher
's
victim
which
ar
anim
like
marionett
,
and
stargher
himself
in
a
giant
purpl
cape
that
span
the
wall
of
hi
mental
throne
room
.
if
the
film
had
continu
within
thi
dirti
monstrou
world
i
would
have
deem
the
film
brilliant
,
but
ala
,
the
sequenc
onli
becom
more
silli
as
thei
go
along
(
despit
a
pain
nippl
ring
remov
later
in
the
film
)
.
the
cast
is
basic
just
an
excus
for
there
to
be
some
moder
plot
semblanc
dure
the
parad
of
imag
,
but
at
least
vincent
d'onofrio
turn
in
hi
usual
bizarr
and
psychot
perform
(
magnifi
by
ten
,
thank
to
the
environ
in
which
the
film
ha
been
place
)
.
in
my
opinion
,
d'onofrio
wa
on
of
the
best
creepi
actor
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
film
,
but
hi
film
choic
as
of
late
have
been
so
complet
aw
(
i

e

-
the

,
the
thirteenth
floor
,
and
the
veloc
of

)
that
i
have
begun
to
rethink
my
initi
assess
of
him
.
the
charact
of
stargher
is
an
excel
role
for
him
though
,
and
will
probabl
lead
to
a
bit
of
typecast
for
him
.
detractor
of
violenc
and
disturb
imag
will
want
to
stai
far
awai
from
thi
film
,
as
it
contain
heavi
dose
of
both
.
besid
the
nippl
ring
remov
i
mention
abov
,
there
is
also
stargher
's
penchant
for
hang
suspend
off
of
the
floor
by
the
ring
that
pierc
hi
back
and
leg
(
prior
to
hi
catatonia
and
captur
)
which
will
have
audienc
recoil
.
a
sequenc
where
catherin
enter
stargher
's
mind
and
find
him
recreat
the
disembowel
of
hi
first
victim
is
also
pretti
disquiet
.
on

as

,
the

is
sore
lack
.
as
a
collect
of
imag
though
,
the
cell
is
extrem
well
done
.
although
the
latter
sequenc
in
the
film
contain
fewer
disturb
imageri
than
the
first
half
,
singh
ha
done
what
he
supposedli
set
out
to
do
:
make
a
film
sole
for
the
purpos
of
string
some
remark
imag
togeth
.
unfortun
,
a
well-written
script
should
have
been
consid
too
,
becaus
without
it
the
cell
just
seem
like
ani
other
music

we
could
see
on

(
provid
,
of
cours
,
that
mtv

for
the

)
.
when
cast
the
kei
part
of
the
voic
of
mose
,
most
peopl
's
first
candid
would
probabl
not
be
the
controversi
actor
val

,
but
he

the

of

prove
to
be

wow

a
cast
.
ok
here

the
plot
in
thi
movi
:
linda
fiorentino
plai
a
regular
woman
who
work
at
an
abort
clinic
.
on
dai
at
her
hous
metatron
(

two
fallen
angel
(
matt
damon
and
ben

)
from

heaven
by
wai
of
a
church
.
ok
now
get
thi
,
she
is
told
to
find
two
prophet
:
on
who
talk
a
lot
and
on
who
doe
n't
,
howev
she
get
jai
and
silent
bob
instead
(
who
give
us
great
perform
)
.
now
on
her
wai
to
new
jersei
with
jai
and
silent
bob
to
try
and
stop
the
two
angel
the
13th
apostl
fall
out
of
the
sky
(
chri
rock
)
and
help
guid
her
to
find
these
angel
.
salma
hayek
plai
serendip
who
also
help
her
out
along
her
wai
.
azrael
(
jason
lee
)
who
is
a
demon
is
try
to
help
the
two
angel
out
so
that
thei
can
win
.
bethani
(
linda
fiorentino
)
ha
to
now
us
the
help
of
all
these
peopl
to
try
and
stop
the
angel
befor
thei
cheat
their
wai
back
to
heaven
lead
to
a
violent
and
bloodi
end
that
will
make
you
think
twice
about
your
faith
.
what
a
movi
,
it
is
everyth
roll
into
on
:
an
offens
,
offbeat
,
smart
and
sassi
comedi
that
surprisingli
ha
a
great
messag
at
the
end
,
and
end
up
be
a
feel-good
movi
.
who
would
have
known
kevin
had
such
a
soft
side
on
him
that
could
make
us
know
that
he
is
a
faith
person
himself
.
now
for
those
of
you
who
get
offend
with
thi
movi
realli
should
not
take
it
to
heart
.
ye
it
mai
target
the
cathol
commun
and
bash
them
a
lot
,
but
it
also
seem
to
rather
than
go
against
god
and
heaven
,
it
actual
goe
with
god
and
kevin
give
a
messag
that
there
is
a
god
.
thi
review
mai
sound
confus
at
first
but
realli
the
onli
wai
to
understand
it
is
to
see
thi
excel
movi
.
kevin
goe
to
new
length
in
thi
hilari
comedi
and
give
us
some
great
charact
with
not
too
much
background
or
studi
and
rather
we
start
to
know
the
charact
as
we
watch
the
movi
.
of
cours
the
best
(
and
funniest
)
of
them
all
is
the
onli
duo
in
histori
that
have
made
me
fall
out
of
my
chair
laugh
and
that
my
friend
ar
jai
and
silent
bob
.
probabl
the
best
charact
in
movi
that
i
like
.
the
star-stud
cast
is
amaz
and
ha
some
other
cameo
by
georg
carlin
,
jeann
garafolo
and
so
mai
more
that
we
start
to
lose
track
after
a
while
.
the
script
wa
written
by
kevin
smith
with
mani
f'word
in
there
of
cours
and
a
strong
emphasi
on
sexual
talk
but
he
also
seem
to
concentr
on
what
is
import
rather
that
what
is
n't
and
make
us
laugh
at
the
same
time
as
we
think
.
chri
rock
give
a
hilari
perform
and
get
into
hi
charact
veri
well
,
with
some
classic
line
.
linda
fiorentino
is
just
perfect
for
her
role
and
make
us
believ
that
she
realli
is
who
she
is
.
of
cours
jason
mew
and
kevin
smith
do
a
great
job
as
jai
and
silent
bob
with
some
priceless
line
from
jai
(
as
well
as
silent
bob
)
.

be
oscar
winner
for
the
classic
'good

thei
give
great
perform
here
again
but
matt
damon
seem
just
a
littl
held
back
and
to
me
did
not
give

all
he
could
.
ben
howev
wa
all
out
and
got
veri
much
into
hi
charact
as
well
as
the
stori
.
the
movi
's
onli
big
flaw
is
that
it
ha
a
few
unfunni
line
and
some
slow
part
to
go
along
with
it
.
howev
the
direct

as
well
as
the
priceless

of

'dogma

as
a

and
i
think
i
can
safe
compar
it
to
'clerk

by

an
interest
thought
struck
me
after
the
movi
wa
over
,
and
that
is
that
the
wing
of
the
dove
almost
fit
the
stori
line
of
a
film
noir
.
a
coupl
conspir
to
cheat
someon
out
of
their
monei
so
thei
can
live
happili
ever
after
.
their
involv
in
the
decept
make
each
less
attract
to
the
other
,
and
after
a
few
thing
go
wrong
,
the
whole
idea
seem
like
an
aw
life-ruin
mistak
.
i
would
n't
call
the
wing
of
the

a
film
noir
,
but
the
comparison
is
interest
.
as
i

mel
goe

payback
is
often
a
veri
violent
film
.
to
it
credit
,
there
ar
a
few
scene
that
could
have
been
veri
graphic
,
but
the
director
(
i
'm
not
sure
which
on
--
more
about
that
in
a
second
)
made
the
choic
to
let
the
audienc
us
their
imagin
instead
of
subject
us
to
the
usual
gratuit
gore
found
in
mani
film
.
the
film
appear
a
bit
disjoint
in
place
,
which
is
understand
consid
produc
/
star
gibson
wa
n't
thrill
with
how
the

turn
out

of
it
re-shot

when
the
director
refus
,
anoth
on
wa
brought
in
to
do
the
re-shoot

so
as
a
result
while
the
final
product
is
appar
better
than
the
origin
(
although
person
i
would
love
to
see
the
origin
version
for
comparison
sake
)
it
doe
get
a
bit
of
a
choppi
feel
to
it
toward
the
end
.
it
's
alwai
tough
to
make
a
film
where
the
main
charact
is
a
villain
,
unless
that
person
ha
some
redeem
qualiti
.
in
thi
case
,
gibson
's
charact
ha
few
redeem
qualiti
.
but
hei
,
it
mel
,
so
even
when
he
is
kill
peopl
in
cold
blood
we
ar
still
root
for
him
.
my
guess
is
that
if
that
you
put
some
other
johnni

i
want
to
correct
what
i

in

i
still

be
the
number

in

would
have
been
better
choic
for
the

but
i
ca
n't
deni
the
import
of
``
the
bridg
on
the
river
kwai
``
-
cinemat
and
in
it
content
.
the
film
is
set
in
burma
in
1943
.
a
bataillon
of

in

respect

afterward
col

nicholson
assidu
commit
himself
for
the
build
of
the
bridg
.
he
consid
it
an
opportun
to
rais
hi
men
's
moral
,
and
he
want
to
prove
superior
british
capabl
to
the
japanes
.
but
the
british
high
command
send
a
few
soldier
who
shall
destroi
the
bridg
,
among
them
the
american
shear
(
william

-
an
escape
from
the
japanes
prison
camp
-
and
the
british
major
warden
(
jack

)
.
.
.
a
flaw
of
the
pictur
is
the
clich
?
d
character
of
the
japanes
peopl
.
thei
ar
present
as
if
thei
were
intellectu
inferior
to
the
british
-
as
if
the
japanes
were
incap
of

the

n't
consist
question
the
militari
spirit
as
kubrick
doe
in

.
lean
seem
rather
fascin
by
the
militari
hierarchi
.
thi
is
also
percept
in
the
convers
between
col
.
nicholson
and
col
.
saito
.
in
thi
regard
it
is
symptomat
that
shear
,
who
doubt
the
militari
logic
,
is
a
somehow
unpleas
person
in
the
film
.
the
audienc
is
suppos
to
applaud
col
.
nicholson
's
persever
concern
the
question
if
hi
offic
shall
work
on
the
bridg
or
not
.
the
spectat
ar
suppos
to
neglect
the
risk
col
.
nicholson
take
for
hi
men
.
(
the
plot
by-pass
these
risk
.
)
that
mean
,
the
pictur
is
n't
perfect
.
but
it
ha
a
lot
of
virtu
as
well
.
it
show
the
``
mad
``
of

and
what
war
can

it
show
how

nicholson
becom
possess
by
the
idea
of
be

and
that

and
``
the
bridg

``
is
an
interest
studi
of
charact
with

these
point
and

make
thi

an

you

you
can
place

you

just
about

you

were

you

ani

,
you

insert

and
when
you
do
that
,
you
get

yet
,
he

like
ani
good
hong

movi
,
blade
is
heavi
on
the
chopsocki

.
for
some
reason
,
blade
spend
a
lot
more
time
us
hi
kung
fu
artistri
than
us
the
tradit
anti-vampir
weapon
of
garlic
and
silver
.
(
blade
dismiss
a
man-portabl
arc
lamp
as
be
too
heavi
,
although
it
look
to
be
a
more
effici

to

)
unfortun

the
guid
hand
of
john

is
absent
from
thi

,
releg
blade
to
the
statu
of
the

it
most
strongli
resembl

the

is
the
last

it

i

the

blade
ha
a
littl
more
go
for
it
,
and
ha
the
vampir
myth
to
draw
from
--
but
other
than
that
,
it
's
the
same
kind
of
movi
--
excit
,
with
well
choreograph
action
scene
,
but
with
no
reson
.
with
a
stronger
villain
(

,
a

might
have
been
abl

rise

as

blade
is
an

remind

for

when

on

``

everi

and
yet
it
somehow
still
work
for
me
.
i
know
i
'm
in
the
minor
here
but
let
me
explain
.
the
film
take
place
in
harrisburg
,
pa
in
1988
dure
an
unseason
warm
winter
.
john
travolta
plai
the
local
big-shot
tv
weatherman
who
is
idol
by
the
townsfolk
as
if
he
were
john
travolta
himself
and
not
the
bumbl
russ
richard
.
russ
is
marri
to
crystal
(
lisa
kudrow
)
,
a
blond
bimbo
if
ever
there
wa
on
in
the
histori
of
cinema
.
she
's
a
selfish
,
nasti
bitch
full
of
lust
and
desir
but
somehow
she
got
the
job
of
the
lotteri
ball
girl
-
not
exactli
the
most
intellectu
tax
job
on
the
market
.
crystal
's
cheat
on
russ
with
their
collect
boss
dick
(
ed
o'neil
)
,
the
tv
station
manag
.
she
doe
n't
seem
to
genuin
like
either
of
them
,
but
it
's
all
she
can
do
in
thi
on-hors
town
.
much
like
``
fargo
,
``
thi
movi
tell
the
stori
of
a
man
who
's
go
broke
and
ha
to
pull
off
a
huge
scam
to
get
rich
quick
.
he
enlist
the
help
of
hi
english
friend
gig
(
tim
roth
)
,
the
local
stripclub
owner
who
tell
him
how
to
fix
the
lotteri
.
along
the
wai
a
subplot
involv
a
two-bit
thug
name
,
accur
,
``
dale
the
thug
``
(
michael
rappaport
)
get
mix
up
in
the
process
.
there
's
also
a
booki
that
somehow
get
thrown
in
the
mix
onc
the
deal
goe
down
.
i
'm
not
go
to
elabor
much
further
on
the
plot
and
stori
becaus
it
continu
to
unwind
and
take
twist
and
turn
you
're
not
expect
.
thi
is
a
farc
,
which
is
basic
a
straightforward
,
adult-orient
comedi
but
doe
n't
go
as
far
as
a
classic
black
comedi
should
.
where
as
``
fargo
``
wa
sometim
shock
and
disturb
while
be
funni
,
``
lucki
number
``
is
just
funni
becaus
you
ca
n't
take
these
charact
in
these
outrag
situat
serious
.
it
's
all
a
big
cartoon
basic
,
but
it
's
funni
and
i
can
respect
that
.
travolta
is
great
in
hi
role
and
even
though
he
's
not
a
realli
likabl
charact
,
he
's
try
to
be
a
nice
gui
despit
the
fact
he
's
a
creep
.
he
's
like
a
gangster
with
moral
who
genuin
feel
sorri
for
the
gui
he
ha
to
kill
.
crystal
is
just
the
opposit
,
she
's
constantli
argu
and
us
whatev
brain
cell
she
ha
left
to
look
out
for
herself
.
kudrow
is
perfect
in
thi
role
sinc
she
's
spent
8
year
on
tv
as
the
dim-wit
phoeb
on
``
friend
.
``
here
is
charact
is
basic
a
veri
evil
incarn
of
phoeb
.
i
have
to
admit
i
wa
honestli
surpris
and
pleas
by
how
the
plot
unravel
and
the
method
each
of
the
main
charact
us
to
try
to
get
their

of
the
monei
.
like
``
jacki
brown
,
``
(
an
elmor
leonard
adapt
)
,
the
stori
is
about
a
circl
of
10

all
after
the
lotteri
monei
that
ha
been
won
illeg
.
the
screenplai
doe
a
fine
job
in
balanc
the
charact
and
slowli
reveal
their
motiv
and
hidden
agenda
while
at
the
same
time
keep
russ
richard
the
main
focu
.
more
and
more
charact
ar
introduc
and
sinc
the
film
ha
such
an
icon
,
cartooni
atmospher
you
can
take
on
faith
just
what
make
the
minor
charact
do
what
thei
do
.
the
end
itself
is
great
.
it
's
surpris
and
funni
and
make
you
feel
good
.
you
realiz
thi
film
ha
pack
in
about
10
differ
movi
'
worth
of
stori
into
two
hour

time
and
did
n't
fall
apart
(
although
mani
other
critic
might
beg
to
differ
)
.
i

it

and
i

then
add
even
more
to
them

there
ar
more
plot
twist
in
thi

than
probabl
ani
i
have
ever
seen
.
and
even
though
you
think
you
mai
get
tire
of

,
the
surpris
ar
so
genuin
that
it
's
rather
pleas
.
go
back
over
them
in
my
mind
,
nearli
all
of
them
work
,
though
some
stretch
the
boundari
of
belief
.
thankfulli
,
the
convolut
plot
doe
n't
give
us
much
time
to
think
about
each
on
,
pounc
yet
anoth
twist
on
us
befor
the
shock
of
the
previou
on
ha
worn
off
.
as
for
the
critic
who
complain
that
the
film
is
trashi
--
well
,
it
is
.
thi
is
pretti
much
just
on
trashi
film
.
howev
,
it
is
the
kind
of
trashi
that
is
n't
hard
to
watch
.
it
's
good
trash
,
in
a
sens
.
on
,
the
screenplai
know
that
it
's
not
to
be
taken
serious
,
and
it
includ
a
lot
of
humor
and
satir
into
the
stori
.
thi
vari
everywher
from
kelli
's
mother
(
theresa
russel
)
,
who
is
more
of
a
caricatur
of
rich
peopl
,
all
the
wai
to
an
ambul-chase
lawyer
(
bill
murrai
)
,
who
wear
a
neck-brace
to
cover
an
insur
scam
he
is
run
.
bill
murrai
also
provid
the
best
charact
in
the
film
,
and
most
of
the
genuin
laugh
.
and
two
,
the
sex
is
more
than
gratuit
,
although
not
unwelcom
.
wild
thing
is
suppos
to
have
sex
in
it
(
what
film
with
that
titl
would
n't
?
)
,
and
thi
movi
break
the
boundari
.
instead
of
have
heterosexu
sex
scene
,
it
also
includ
lesbian
scene
between
denis
richard
and
neve
campbel
(
do
n't
worri
.
.
.
it
's
not
as
graphic
as
you
might
think
)
.
the
heterosexu
scene
ar
quit
graphic
,
but
the
surpris
shocker
is
kevin
bacon
's
full-frontal
nude
scene
.
it
's
veri
brief
,
so
if
you
blink
,
you
mai
miss
(
ahem
)
it
.
and
,
for
as
long
as
i
can
rememb
,
i
do
n't
think
i
have
seen
an
r-rate
film
show
an
erect
on
befor
(
it
's
not
complet
,
but
judg
from
the
audienc
'
reaction
,
it
wa
more
than
thei
expect
too
)
.
also
,
dure
on
scene
late
in
the
film
,
there
seem
to
be
a
relationship
brew
between
bacon
and
dillon
's
charact
,
but
noth
came
of
it
(
make
you
wonder
if
the
director
had
to
cut
it
in
order
for
the
r
rate
,
or
if
the
actor
refus
to
do
it
)
.
what
first
made
me
want
to
see
wild
thing
wa
it
cast
.
neve
campbel
,
of
cours
,
ha
been
on
of
my
favorit
actress
sinc
the
scream
film
were
releas
.
here
,
howev
,
she
turn
everi
typic
role
she
ha
done
on
it
head
and
plai
a
gothic
pothead
.
the
closest
role
to
thi
wa
her
perform
in
the
craft
(
though
even
in
that
she
wa
a
nice
girl
)
.
campbel
is
probabl
the
best
in
the
film
and
show
her
wide
rang
of
talent
.
you
can
tell
she
will
be
around
for
a
long
time
.
denis
richard
will
also
be
around
for
a
long
time
,
although
she
mai
be
limit
to
the
role
without
much
rang
.
here
,
she
get
to
express
more
emot
than
in
her
stiff
(
yet
effect
)
perform
in
starship
trooper
.
hopefulli
on
dai
she
will
land
a
veri
good
role
that
can
displai
her
abil
.
and
then
there
is
daphn
rubin-vega
,
a
newcom
to
the
movi
.
she
give
a
veri
good
perform
,
although
her
charact
is
mostli
left
to
the
background
for
the
first
hour
and
a
half
.
toward
the
end
she
doe
get
a
bigger
part
.
on
the
male
side
,
matt
dillon
is
probabl
the
best
,
give
a
subtl
perform
that
surpris
with
everi
twist
.
kevin
bacon
ha
a
slightli
wooden
charact
,
but
he
make
the
most
of
it
.
you
must
have
admir
,
though
,
for
what
he
did
on
screen
.
and
judg
from
mani
of
the
women
's
reaction
in
the
theater
to
that
shot
,
thei
have
grown
a
deeper
appreci
for
bacon
(
yeah
,
right
)
.
and
then
there
is
bill
murrai
.
hi
perform
is
the
comic
relief
,
and
he
nearli
steal
the
film
.
as
a
whole
,
the
entir
cast
work
wondrous
togeth
,
and
thei
seem
at
home
,
even
when
do
the
menag
a
troi
.
director
john
mcnaughton
,
who
ha
previous
done
the
critic
acclaim
henri
:
portrait
of
a
serial
killer
,
ha
construct
a
wonderfulli
twisti
plot
that
work
.
hi
direct
is
smooth
and
stylish
.
the
visual
ar
strike
,
fill
with
rich
color
,
and
almost
so
realist
that
we
can
actual
breath
the
humid
in
the
air
.
howev
,
he
seem
more
at
home
when
the
actor
ar
n't
talk
.
hi
fly-by
shot
of
the
swampi
area
ar
brilliant
,
and
hi
photographi
of
denis
richard
'
climb
out
of
the
pool
is
a
highlight
.
the
cinematographi
is
gorgeou
in
it
detail
.
it
not
often
that
you
see
a
film
like
thi
,
and
we
should
watch
it
just
to
see
how
the
camera
can
take
pictur
.
then
,
there
is
the
music
.
thi
wa
probabl
the
most
obviou
thing
to
me
,
as
it
set
the
perfect
mood
for
the
film
.
it
's
hard
to
describ
in
word
,
so
just
see
the
film
and
listen
to
it
.
it
's
wonderfulli
compos
and
present
.
and
be
sure
to
stick
around
dure
the
close
credit
!
mcnaughton
ha
final
put
the
end
credit
to
good
us
(
while
most
comedi
us
it
for
outtak
)
.
he
ha
includ
some
small
scene
which
help
explain
the
preced
event
.
some
mai
sai
that
these
ar
lame
attempt
to
explain
the
convolut

the

the

i
ca
n't
stress
it
enough
:

the

there

there
's
littl
here
that
we

the

down-right

embarrass

the

that

by
seem
to
have
it
origin
somewher

where
?
ar
we
to
believ
that
the

in

ha
n't

there

why

why

seem

i

not

``

is
a
bad

at
all
.
it
's
a
veri
enjoy
film
with
ton
of
great
moment
,
and
lot
of
great
thing
about
it
.
the
act
is
amaz
,
with
two
oscar-nomin-worthi
perform
from
damon

william

who
have
amaz
chemistri

we

get

great
support

,
ben

,
and
from
minni

,
who
plai
will

skylar
.
there
ar
ton
of
individu
moment
that
i
ador
.
i
love
all
the
comedi
in
the
film
,
especi
a
scene
where
damon
prove
a

of
a
colleg

who
is
quot
a
historian
to
impress
some
chick
,
hi
variou
attempt
at
therapi
,
and
of
cours
,
my
favorit
scene
in
the
entir
film
,
the
on
where
he
deliv
a
long
,
exstens
rant
to
some
nsa
agent
about
the
downsid
of
work
for
them
.
i
like
the
relationship
between
some
of
the
peopl
,
like
will
and
skylar
,
will
and
sean
,
sean
and
lambeau
,
and
will
and
hi
friend
.
there
ar
scene
between
them
which
ar
just
amaz
to
watch
.
and
there
ar
even
moment
in
the
film
which
ar
so
honest
in
their
portray
,
that
i
felt
rightfulli
uncomfort
.
like
the
break-up
scene
between
will
and
skylar
,
will
and
sean
's
first
meet
,
a
bar
scene
between
sean
and
lambeau
,
and
a
scene
where
sean
tell
in
detail
how
he
doe
n't
regret
meet
hi
first
wife
,
who
would
later
suffer
a
slow
,
pain
death
,
and
leav
him
lone
and
slightli
bitter
.
howev
,
the
main
flaw
of
the
film
is
there
's
too
much
of
everyth
,
and
not
enough
of
it
either
.
the
film
tri
for
deeper
relat
between
the
charact
,
but
thei
're
sometim
either
overwritten
or
underwritten
.
take
for
exampl
the
relationship
between
sean
and
will
:
the
film
get
an
interest
father/son
as
well
as
doctor/patient
relationship
go
with
out
ani
problem
,
but
when
it
tri
to
show
them
as
equal
,
it
fall
on
it
face
.
we
hear
how
thei
went
to
the
same
town
,
and
there
ar
even
scene
where
the
film
show
how
hypocrit
both
of
them
ar
at
time
.
but
thi
never
take
off
like
the
other
part
of
their
relationship
do
.
also
,
will
's
relationship
with
hi
best
friend
,
chucki
(
affleck
)
,
ha
a
nice
climax
,
but
not
enough
rise
action
.
we
see
them
joke
around
,
but
when
chucki
arriv
at
a
decis
between
the
two
of
them
,
it
seem
more
like
a
superfici
reason
than
a
more
select
on
.
their
relationship
never
goe
beyond
``
just
best
friend
,
``
and
hi
decis
just
seem
to
be
a
gener
of
ani
two
best
friend
instead
of
someth
more
.
.
.
human
.
mayb
it
wa
just
me
.
and
it
also
goe
for
a
parallel
with
the
relationship
between
sean
and
lambeau
,
but
that
,
again
,
is
underwritten
.
and
,
of
cours
,
as
in
most
film
like
thi
,
the
girl/boi
relationship
is
pretti
underwritten
.
we
never
understand
what
thei
see
in
each
other
,
so
when
skylar
confess
that
she
love
him
,
it
seem
more
like
it
's
there
for
plot
detail
that
anyth
els
.
minni
driver
is
interest
,
though
,
and
breath
life
into
her
charact
.
the
write
is
a
bit
at
fault
here
,
but
what
make
all
thi
worthwhil
is
the
littl
moment
in
the
film
where
it
acheiv
true
awesom
.
sure
,
it
feel
overstuf
,
but
it
's
extrem
enjoy
.
the
dialogu
that
affleck
and
damon
have
written
is
amazingli
fresh
,
and
seem
extrem
human
.
i
think
that
thei
should
get
a
nomin
for
their
script
chiefli
becaus
of
the
dialogu
,
which
is
amaz
.
while
thi
is
probabl
director
gu
van
sant
's
most
conserv
film
(
you
'd
hardli
know
it
's
the
same
director
of
``

for
,
``
the
onli
van
sant
film
i
've
seen

,
it
's
still
a
pretti
remark
film
,
albeit
a
tad
overr
(
what
's
thi
``
best
pictur
``
deal
?
)
.
and
if
a
film
put
a
smile
on
my
face
despit
posess
a
lot
of
flaw
,
i
have
no
problem
with
reccomend
it
to
anyon
.
i
guess
it
's
a
credit
to
jacki

the

it

the
second

not

think
about
how
i
've
wait
for
what
seem
like
forev
to
see
it
and
how
i
'm
see
it
on
a
tv
set
on
a
premium
cabl
channel
and
not
a
giant
movi
theatr
,
it
realli
affect
me
emotion
.
the
stori
itself
is
a
surprisingli
heartbreak
on
,
which
is
why
it
's
such
a
good
novel
,
and
why
thi
is
such
a
good
film
.
the
stori
of
a
pedophil
obsess
with
a
young
14-year
old
girl
name
dolor
a
.
k
.
a
.
lolita
is
great
becaus
it
's
not
trash
for
the
pervert
but
becaus
it
's
about
human
obsess
with
thing
that
ar
out
of
on
's
reach
.
it
protagonist
,
the
comic-name
humbert
humbert
,
is
not
your
averag
pedophil
,
but
a
serious
wound
human
be
who
embodi
how
we
ar
all
destroi
by
our
sick
obsess
and
idosyncrasi
.
the
charact
of
lolita
is
almost
a
symbol
of
the
forbidden
appl
in
christian
mytholog
,
someth
that
will
destroi
us
but
that
we
ca
n't
live
without
.
these
idea
ar
all
work
into
thi
film
nice
,
but
done
in
a
wai
that
is
not
heavi-hand
at
all
,
but
instead
lyric
and
emotion
devast
.
the
focu
of
thi
film
,
and
the
reason
for
make
it
,
it
seem
,
wa
to
realli
penetr
the
emot
depth
of
the
novel
and
bring
them
to
life
on
the
screen
in
beautifulli
dramat
imag
,
and
scene
which
ar
blatantli
over-styliz
.
the
tone
of
the
book
is
a
comic
on
,
but
it
's
also
a
tragic
on
,
and
humbert
,
tell
the
stori
from
hi
perspect
,
blow
everi
singl
thing
out
of
perspect
.
humbert
exist
in
a
fantsi
world
of
hi
obsess
and
desir
,
and
thi
reflect
the
wai
the
entir
film
ha
been
design
.
we
get
a
sens
that
perhap
it
's
by
do
thi
that
humbert
ha
realli
trap
himself
into
a
fate
that
will
ultim
leav
him
haggard
and
destroi
.
he
weep
uncontrol
and
never
let
himself
get
over
hi
origin
14-year-old
love
,
and
allow
himself
to
embodi
her
as
lolita
.
he
let
hi
feel
for
her
navig
all
hi
decis
,
and
by
the
end
,
he
ha
noth
but
overli-dramat
feel
for
her
.
the
stori
recogn
the
extrem
of
thi
,
almost
out
of
a
test
,
see
if
the
reader
will
realli
sympath
with
someon
who
is
social
deem
a
pervert
,
and
on
almost
wonder
while
read
the
book
if
the
author
,
vladimir
nabokov
,
wrote
the
book
as
a
mean
to
bring
into
focu
hi
own
sick
obsess
,
and
perhap
bring
them
to
peac
.
the
weirdest
thing
about
thi
film
is
that
by
the
end
,
when
humbert
ha
reach
the
final
of
hi
obsession
journei
,
we
can
easili
sympath
and
even
identifi
with
him
.
the
open
and
final
imag
of
the
film
ar
the
same
,
and
who
ha
n't
done
a
similar
action
,
that
is
wander
about
without
ani
sens
of
realiti
or
anyth
els
but
a
deep
sad
in
us
?
thi
is
the
second
time
the
novel
ha
been
adapt
for
the
screen
,
the
first
time
be
film
in
-
shock
-
1962
,
by
stanlei
kubrick
,
who
could
n't
possibl
have
brought
the
novel
to
the
screen
with
as
much
faith
as
lyne
ha
been
abl
to
do
,
but
did
the
next
best
thing
:
he
econom
for
everyth
and
came
up
with
a
droll
black
comedi
about
obsess
in
gener
.
in
that
film
,
he
us
the
trap
of
societi
as
benefit
.
the
studio
demand
the
final
scene
,
that
of
a
heinou
murder
,
come
first
in
the
film
so
to
portrai
humbert
first
as
a
murder
and
second
as
a
pedophil
.
.
.
and
when
you
see
it
,
it
give
the
film
depth
of
a
man
trap
by
obsess
.
the
censor
would
n't
allow
anymor
than
a
coupl
glanc
and
subtl
dialogu
to
show
the
,
um
,
relationship
between
humbert
and
lolita
,
so
kubrick
decid
to
plai
it
as
comedi
,
but
still
allow
the
tragedi
to
seep
through
.
look
at
these
two
version
,
especi
after
read
the
novel
(
and
we
all
know
that
when
we
've
read
a
novel
and
see
a
film
adapt
,
we
ar
bound
to
be
anger
by
ani
size
differ
)
,
it
's
realli
imposs
to
compar
them
.
thei
both
go
for
differ
thing
,
and
on
ha
a
lot
more
room
to
be
as
sexual
frank
as
the
novel
wa
.
and
although
it
's
true
that
sever
scene
ar
similar
,
and
ar
thu
up
for
comparison
,
overal
it
's
unfair
to
sai
which
on
is
better
and
which
on
is
wors
.
i
have
never
been
on
for
sai
the
level
of
great
of
a
film
adapt
of
a
novel
is
deem
by
how
faith
it
is
,
and
i
wo
n't
sai
that
here
.
howev
,
thi
film
is
pretti
amaz
,
mostli
becaus
hei
,
i
love
the
book
,
and
thi
film
nearli
remind
me
of
it
.
it
doe
n't
have
nearli
as
much
wit
(
a
coupl
comic
scene
,
and
even
a
lot
of
good
chuckl
,
but
just
not
total
witti
)
,
but
it
doe
have
the
same
emot
toll
that
the
novel
had
.
some
of
that
is
in
the
cast
of
the
two
lead
.
jeremi
iron
,
with
hi
deep
,
soft
british
voic
and
gentl
look
,
is
an
amaz
humbert
.
he
's
droll
in
a
veri
uniqu
wai
,
and
,
well
,
no
on
can
look
distraught
the
wai
he
doe
.
he
bring
a
wonder
sympathi
to
the
role
that
goe
beyond
patho
and
realli
come
up
as
be
easi
to
identifi
with
the
audienc
.
and
when
he
look
at
lolita
with
love
,
and
she
look
at
him
with
lust
,
you
know
that
he
's
her
prison
for
as
long
as
he
live
.
and
dominiqu
swain
,
who
plai
the
titl
charact
,
is
rather
incred
.
she
pull
off
the
tough
role
even
better
than
sue
lyon
did
in
the
origin
,
wonderfulli
balanc
the
qualiti
of
seduct
,
brati
,
and
self-centered
that
mark
the
charact
.
it
's
easi
to
see
why
she
surrend
to
humbert
:
she
love
the
attent
,
and
know
that
she
can
have
her
wai
with
him
at
ani
time
.
when
he
deni
her
someth
,
she
blackmail
him
effortlessli
(
a
scene
involv
a
rock
chair
and
a
littl
foot
action
is
damn
near
classic
)
,
and
when
he
stand
up
to
her
,
she
weep
and
run
awai
,
leav
humbert
to
follow
her
.
there
ar
two
other
minor
charact
in
the
film
,
on
who
's
a
road
block
in
the
begin
,
and
the
other
who
's
a
reappear
threat
to
the
relationship
.
the
former
is
charlott
,
lolita
's
mother
,
plai
by
melani
griffith
.
in
the
book
,
charlott
is
a
monster
of
a
woman
:
overbear
,
constantli
scold
her
child
,
overli-religi
,
and
ultim
selfish
.
and
she
's
the
on
obstacl
humbert
ha
to
overcom
to
obtain
hi
goal
,
at
least
in
the
begin
.
as
plai
by
shelli
winter
in
the
origin
,
she
repres
all
these
qualiti
;
as
plai
by
griffith
here
,
she
's
about
half
of
them
.
it
's
annoi
to
watch
a
film
and
plai
a
game
where
you
try
to
see
who
could
have
done
the
role
wai
better
than
the
on
on
screen
without
mention
the
actor
who
plai
them
first
.
and
even
though
griffith
is
not
realli
bad
,
persai
,
she
's
noth
more
.
the
other
is
clare
quilti
,
the
writer
who
is
also
try
to
seduc
lolita
,
and
succe
,
but
at
a
price
.
langella
take
a
total
differ
direct
than
the
on
peter
sellar
took
in
the
origin
.
quilti
wa
a
comic
charact
in
the
origin
:
a
threat
in
the
form
of
mani
form
,
pop
in
state
of
rambl
,
german
,
prone
,
and
eventu
drunk
.
langella
take
the
other
rout
,
allow
all
of
the
creepi
to
be
unearth
,
and
the
result
is
a
charact
who
exist
in
shadow
and
low
shot
,
and
who
meet
a
wonderfulli
iron
end
,
the
exact
opposit
of
what
we
thought
of
him
.
as
you
can
see
,
most
of
these
ar
not
improv
or
mistak
done
on
the
part
of
lyne
and
hi
screenwrit
,
stephen
schiff
,
but
just
part
of
a
whole
new
look
at
the
novel
,
at
least
cinema-wise
.
thi
version
is
beauti
,
and
perpetu
sadden
.
the
camera
movement
ar
styliz
,
and
each
shot
is
breathtakingli
rich
.
the
act
is
for
the
most
part
wonder
,
and
when
we
watch
it
,
we
realli
get
a
sens
that
for
humbert
,
who
is
tell
the
stori
,
the
onli
two
peopl
on

most
of
the
time
were

more
importantli
,
it
take
us
right
up

then

jacki
,
a
bit
jealou
,
work
and
work
at
her
plai
skill
,
and
soon
the
tabl

turn
.
when
thei
both
hit

strive
for
a
comeback
,
while
her
sister
is
plai
in
famou
hall

the

of
a

joy
conductor
,
kiffer

(
david

,
in

semi-star-make
turn
)
.
thei
marri
,
after
a
short
courtship
,
and
move
to
a
love
countri
hous
,
make
jacki
incred
jealou
sinc
her
cello
plai
becom
a
symbol
of
her
current
life
:
when
she
plai
,
she
ha
the
ey
of
the
world
,
but
when
she
stop
,
she
's
alon
.
she
enter
into
a
shallow
relationship
with
an
equal
famou
pianist
,
daniel
barenboim
(
jame
frain
)
,
in
hope
that
she
mai
overcloud
her
sister
,
but
she
eventu
begin
to
lose
it
,
and
run
awai
to
hilari
's
countri
home
,
where
she
hope
to
gain
admitt
by
hilari
to
sleep
with
her
husband
,
sinc
no
on
she
sleep
with
give
her
ani
pleasur
.
it
's
all
terribl
melodramt
,
as
you
can
see
,
and
by
the
time
jacki
ha
contract
ms
(
in
a
brilliantli
edit
scene
that
surpass
the
breakdown
scene
in
the
semi-smiliar
``
shine
``
in
technic
and
emot
devast
)
,
it
would
have
been
the
time
that
i
could
easili
call
the
sign
for
melodramat
overload
if
it
had
n't
been
handl
in
such
a
wai
.
the
kei
thing
here
is
that
it
's
not
about
her
gradual
death
and
slip
into
insan
but
rather
that
it
's
about
her
tumultu
relationship
with
her
sister
,
which
,
i
might
add
,
is
perfectli
realiz
.
their
relationship
is
the
most
down-to-earth
complex
entiti
of
the
year
:
thei
love
eachoth
more
than
anyon
els
in
the
entir
world
,
but
thei
're
also
complet
jealou
of
on
anoth
.
when
a
young
jacki
surpass
her
plai
abil
,
she
tri
in
vain
to
make
a
comeback
but
ca
n't
,
and
almost
seem
to
marri
to
get
back
at
jacki
for
her
success
.
when
jacki
land
on
top
and
see
her
sister
marri
a
wonder
man
,
she
is
jealou
of
her
lifestyl
to
the
most
extens
brink
that
i
've
ever
seen
in
a
film
(
onli
two
sister
who
truli
love
eachoth
would
dare
share
the
same
man
)
.
and
the
whole
time
,
their
love
for
eachoth
is
never
doubt
or
even
test
.
anoth
thing
i
realli
like
is
emili
watson
's
perform
.
i
usual
make
it
a
note
to
never
overprais
an
actor
for
plai
either
a
drunkard
or
a
lunat
or
someon
with
a
mortal
diseas
(
or
ani
combin
of
the
three
)
.
my
reason
for
thi
is
that
it
's
a
fuck
easi
job
.
the
worst
case
for
thi
veri
year
mai
be
thandi
newton
in
``
belov
``
:
sure
,
she
's
good
,
but
what
's
so
tough
about
plai
a
woman
who
stumbl
around
,
slur
her
word
togeth
,
and
act
like
a
three
year
old
insid
a
20-year
old
's
bodi
?
hell
,
i
could
plai
that
if
i
had
a
pair
of
breast
.
in
that
same
exact
movi
,
though
,
is
a
perform
by
kimberli
elis
where
she
ha
to
be
the
rock
that
hold
the
famili
togeth
as
her
mother
slowli
goe
insan
,
her
brother
run
off
never
to
be
seen
again
,
and
her
mother
's
lover
is
scare
off
.
she
ha
to
actual
deal
with
real
emot
,
someth
much
harder
than
mere
stumbl
about
.
but
the
academi
of
art
and
scienc
love
love
love
overprais
perform
like
newton
.
if
you
do
n't
believ
me
,
look
at
jack
nicholson
's
perform
in
``
as
good
as
it
get
``
:
great
perform
,
but
easi
job
.
thi
is
n't
so
for
watson
,
though
,
becaus
her
insan
come
from
real
emot
,
not
just
a
plot
point
.
and
thank
to
the
open
sequenc
,
where
we
see
her
and
hilari
as
kid
,
we
understand
the
motiv
behind
all
her
action
,
and
by
the
time
she
actual
contract
ms
and
begin
to
loos
her
saniti
and
her
life
,
we
've
alreadi
understood
that
thi
is
the
last
straw
for
a
woman
plagu
with
terribl
neuros
.
rachel
griffith
,
who
would
have
otherwis
been
the
understudi
to
watson
's
protagonist
,
actual
match
watson
step-for-step
,
becaus
as
watson
grow
insan
,
and
demand
unspeak
thing
from
her
,
griffith
hold
her
own
,
and
ha
to
deal
with
what
she
is
abl
to
give
her
sister
who
need
emot
help
from
her
.
griffith
,
an
otherwis
unknown
actress
(
and
watson
be
famou
from
``
break
the
wave
``
and
``
the
boxer
``
)
,
is
absolut
brilliant
,
just
as
absolut
brilliant
as
watson
is
,
and
if
the
academi
and
all
the
other
critic
group
,
who
've
alreadi
deem
watson
's
perform
the
best
of
the
year
,
glanc
over
her
becaus
she
's
the
on
who
doe
n't
get
to
go
insan
(
read
:
she
get
the
bore
role
)
,
then
the
scream
of
hysteria
you
hear
will
be
from
me
.
after
all
,
griffith
ha
the
thankless
job
of
keep
thing
real
-
the
tom
cruis
role
in
``
rainman
``
(
the
on
who
should
have
gotten
oscar
consider
and
not
hoffman
)
.
she
doe
,
and
if
anyon
deserv
accolad
from
the
academi
thi
year
,
it
's
griffith
.
togeth
,
the
two
actress
work
extrem
well
,
though
,
and
both
have
to
go
through
deep
emot
hell
,
the
like
of
which
have
n't
been
seen
thi
year
.
if
it
had
n't
been
for
an
otherwis
not-total-great
final
section
that
deal
wai
too
much
with
jacki
and
not
enough
with
hilari
(
when
the
two
had
gotten
equal
treatment
for
the
entireti
)
,
i
'd
sai
thi
is
on
of
the
top
ten
best
film
of
the
year
.
it
's
so
close
to
perfect
,
in
it
structur
,
it
treatment
of
it
subject
,
and
it
beauti
technic
specif
(
cinematographi
nomin
,
without
a
shred
of
doubt
in
my
mind
,
and
mayb
film
edit
)
,
that
it
's
nearli
a
shame
that
it
's
not
the
flawless
gem
that
it
should
be
.
but
,
hei
,
as
it
is
,
i
can
hardli
complain
.
as
i
write
the
review
for
the
new

thankfulli

ephron
ha
a

support
cast
with
posei
,
kinnear
,
chappel
,
and
a

,
includ
a
great
scene
involv
brother
,
aunt
,
and
two
sweet
kid
.
it
's
all
cute
and
wonder
,
and
for
all
of
the
ideal
,
it
make
me
feel
good
.
hank
is
as
obnoxi
as
ever
on
the
outsid
and
as
warm
on
the
insid
as
he
alwai
is
.
he
is
,
i
believ
,
america
's
greatest
actor
.
doe
he
show
it
here
?
nah
.
but
he
's
still
tom
hank
,
and
she
's
still
meg
ryan
.
which
is
what
thi
movi
boil
down
to
.
it
's
pure
confect
.
all
the
bit
about
the
godfath
,
the
joke
,
the
superb
script
,
it
's
all
realli
sweet
.
there
ar
some
immens
flaw
,
like
pace
.
the
last
third
of
the
movi
realli
doe
n't
work
as
well
as
i
would
have
like
,
and
for
a
romant
comedi
,
it
's
slow
.
onc
hank
know
the
secret
,
it
get
realli
slow
.
i
even
look
at
my
watch
a
coupl
time
,
to
make
sure
ephron
wa
go
to
deliv
the
big
onscreen
kiss
i
wa
wait
for
,
so
that
i
could
get
home
at
a
reason
hour
.
the
other
problem
is
that
thi
movi
is
shape
up
to
be
realli
date
.
e-mail
?
when
my
kid
ar
my
ag
,
i
do
n't
know
what
we
'll
be
us
.
but
hank
can
do
more
with
on
eyerol
than
anybodi
,
and
meg
ryan
just
love
to
dive
into
a
pillow
better
than
anyon
in
movi
histori
.
thei
just
work
togeth
,
and
it
's
nice
to
see
.
it
give
you
,
well
,
a
smile
.
the
script
help
with
some
great
line
that
ar
absolut
hilari
,
and
that
alwai
come
at
the
exact
right
time
to
keep
the
audienc
awak
.
i
wa
argu
with
my
father
on
the
drive
back
home
on
what
the
purpos
of
movi
wa
.
i
've
alwai
believ
that
movi
ar
veri
power
,
veri
power
inde
.
you
see
,
mankind
ha
three
abil
he
need
to
surviv
:
the
abil
to
think
,
entertain
,
and
procreat
.
movi
can
definit
do
the
first
two
,
and
as
for
the
third
,
well
,
i
'd
rather
not
think
about
that
.
i
alwai
thought
film
that
made
you
think
enlighten
you
and
made
you
see
someth
from
anoth
viewpoint
,
and
that
film
that
entertain
you
were
good
,
becaus
you
forgot
about
your
troubl
and
thought
about
someth
nice
for
a
night

and
i
wa
think
about
how
incred
a
year
tom

ha
had

hank
wa
the
drive
forc
behind
on
of
the
year
's
best
film
in

privat
ryan
,
which
is
on
of
those
think
film
that
truli
made
someon
wonder
about
the
world
.
he
's
also
half
of
the
glue
behind
the
year
's
best
exampl
of
pure
entertain
.
tom
hank
and
meg
ryan
ar
magic
,
as
is
thi
movi
.
it
's
a
sweet
,
love
affair
with
a
technolog
twist
.
it
mai
be
a
long
commerci
,
but
it
gave
me
a
pretti
big
smile
on
my
face
.
ar
we
victim

the

what

interest

that

the
stori
of

the

begin
to
feel

in

especi
in
the
treatment
of

.
the
sex
role
in
the
film
ar
weirdli
out
of
place
in
the
90
's
,
like
someth
out
of
a
revisionist
look
.
all
the
men
drink
too
much
and
slap
their

too
much
dure
some
portion
of

.
there
ar
,
howev

endear
moment
in

capra
put
in
just
enough
humor
mock
the
sex
role
of
the
50

to
make

.
the
stori
is
hacknei

and
the

a

there

thi

especi
the

it
's
a
littl
too
nice
for

there
is
,
howev
,
enough
humor
,
enough

enough
of
jimmi
stewart
to
get
the

which
would
be
the

watch

it

for

doe

no

thi

it

the

doe

at

royal
ambit
and

ar
at

english
wall
.
after
thi
the
film
stai
mostli
on
the
battlefield
,
where
besson
demonstr
hi
abil
to
direct
amaz
action
sequenc
,
onli
occasion
resort
to
a
calmer
tempo
.
the
movi
is
fill
with
dreami
,
symbol
imag
of
pure
artist
craftsmanship
,
that
creat
a
surreal
and
occasion
paranoiac
atmospher
.
the
film
is
lost
in
time
and
space
,
hyster
jump
back
and
forth
in
jeann
's
thought
,
imagin
and
conscienc
.
besson
's
visual
style
permit
the
audienc
to
enter
the
mediev
ag
,
feel
the
smell
of
fresh
blood
and
the
adrenalin
pump
in
your
bodi
in
the
heat
of
battl
.
but
the
film
is
far
from
be
flawless
.
the
script
need
a
lot
of
polish
.
except
for
jeann
,
there
ar
no
real
charact
.
and
although
a
grand
star
cast
is
assembl
,
their
charact
ar
noth
more
than
prop
,
not
more
aliv
than
the
costum
that
thei
ar
wear
.
as
for
the
maiden
of
lorrain
herself
,
she
is
portrai
as
a
simpl
girl
,
too
small
for
her
divin
task
.
in
the
latter
part
of
the
film
,
we
see
her
as
hyster
,
confus
and
on
the
brink
of
mad
,
with
her
past
puriti
and
innoc
for
ever
lost
.
jovovich
handl
the
part
with
more
panach
than
on
might
expect
.
but
though
her
screen
time
is
incred
excess
,
both
malcovich
(
'be
john
malcovich
'
)
and
dunawai
(
'titu
'
)
surpass
her
rather
overact
and
simpli
unprofession
perform
.
and
even
hoffman
manag
to
breath
some
life
into
hi
dreadfulli
small
part
.
besid
cast
jovovich
,
besson
's
onli
mistak
is
hi
extrem
sens
of
patriot
that
in
the
end
ruin
hi
so
glorious
craft
paint
.
there
ar
some
viscous
evil
englishmen
that
murder
,
pillag
and
betrai
with
a
smile
on
their
face
.
and
some
incred
brave
and
nobl
frenchmen
,
repres
by
the
``
three
musket
``
of
thi
stori
--
the
brave
gill
de
rai
(
vincent
cassel
)
,
the
wise
aulon
(
desmond
harrington
)
and
the
strong
la
hire
(
richard
ride
)
.
though
all
those
actor
perform
well
,
their
charact
ar
noth
more
than
symbol
--
banner
that
proclaim
the
glori
of
franc
.
and
thu
,
there
is
no
sens
of
realism
in
thi
film
.
'the
messeng
'
ha
muscl
instead
of
brain
.
there
is
some
relief
in
the
end
,
where
besson
lai
down
hi
armor
and
start
think
.
dustin
hoffman
's
appear
help
and
the
film
end
elegantli
and
surprisingli
effect
with
a
climax
worthi
of
prais
.
jeann
's
charact
is
unlock
,
but
whether
god
wa
in
the
pictur
or
not
,
is
never
quit
explain
.
wa
she
a
confus
peasant
girl
driven
by
her
own
hunger
for
reveng
?
or
wa
she
truli
a
messeng
of
god
?
the
film
pose
as
mani
question
as
answer
and
noth
is
complet
obviou
.
bess
o
messeng
'
is
noth
more
than
a
fairli
good
film
.
it
is
not
much
that
you
rememb
of
it
after
you
leav
the
theater
.
mayb
the
sound
,
the
dreami
sequenc
,
but
certainli
not
the
dialogu
.
it
is
an
eleg
and
adrenalin
pump
histori
lesson
for
the
mtv-gener
,
that
although
present
some
interest
materi
,
work
better
when
it
's
on
the
battlefield
.
i
'm
not
quit
sure
what
to
sai
about
mar
attack
!
,
which
is
obvious
the
work
of
a
derang
geniu
.
when
tim

work
,
it
's
breathtak
and
hilari
in
equal
measur

and
when
it
doe
n't

it
's
just
dull
.
i
'm
not
even
sure
it
work
more
often
than
it
doe
n't
,
but
where
it
count
--
that
is
,
when
thi
gleefulli
evil

get
down
to
the
busi
of
blast
us
to

come
--
mar

is
brilliant
.
mar
attack
!
is
base
on
a
rather
unsavori
seri
of
trade
card
releas
by
topp
in
the
1950s
,
and
it
take
it
cue
from
the
same
sourc
as
thi
summer
's
independ
dai
--
old
alien
invas

,
disast

big-budget

ha
a
fulli
develop

the
big
differ
is
that

mar

portrai
us
as
the
greedi

the

splendid
--

out

then
storm

thi

noth

the

``
the

written
by
neil

it

simon
love
to
deconstruct
and
analyz
human
relationship
,
and
he
's
at
the
top
of
hi
game
here
.
as
maddeningli
obnoxi
as
the
grodin
charact
is
,
he
's
the
type
of
gui
that
everyon
know
.
the
charact
of
georg
costanza
on
``
seinfeld
``
seem
to
have
been
model
after
him
.
the
onli
problem
with
the
film
is
that
it
's
not
that
funni
,
and
it
's
bill
as
a
comedi
.
as
much
as
i
could
see
the
realism
in
the
charact
,
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
a
chuckl
here
and
there
.
``
the
heartbreak
kid
``
is
not
a
date
movi
.
it
ha
an
extrem
neg
view
of
relationship
,
so
see
it
with
a
girlfriend/boyfriend
,
could
be
hazardu
to
your
health
.
it
's
a
curiou
thing
-
i
've
found
that
when
willi
is
not
call
on
to
carri
the
whole
movi
,
he
's
much
better
and
so
is
the
movi
.
even
though
,
in
the
sixth
sens
he
is
the
``
name
``
,
he
doe
n't
have
the
pivot
role
.
that
honour
goe
to
halei
osment
who
plai
cole
sear
(
cute
pun
,
seer
)
a
9
year
old
boi
who
can
see

.
if
osment
wa
cute
or
preciou
,
the
director
go
for
the
maudlin
,
thi
would
be
noth
more
than
a
movi-of-the-week
,
thankfulli
,
osment
is
not
onli
better
than
that
,
but
in
some
instanc
,
blow
everyon

off

in
a
bravura
perform
.
we
get
to
see
hi
fear
,
vulner
,
strength
and
intellig
which
make
the
sixth
sens
on
of
the
best
movi
i
've
seen
thi
year
.
the
whole

match
him
in
qualiti
,
with
willi
give
a
fairli
low
kei
perform
that
match
the
subject
matter
.
on
thing
about
thi
movi
,
it
target
.
thi
is
n't
a
sfxfest
like
the
haunt
or
a
gorefest
,
thi
is
more
what
i
'd
call
a
supernatur
drama
,
more
interest
in
charact
than
in
dazzl
you
with
makeup
.
on
caveat
:
there
's
a
love
twist
in
the
movi
,
someth
like
the
usual
suspect
,
where
you
end
up
replai
the
movi
in
your
head
rethink
what
you
have
just
seen
.
i
wa
extrem
lucki
to
see
it
as
a
sneak
preview
in
toronto
,
befor
ani
hype
or
critic
review
were
out
,
so
i
went
in
with
no
bias
.
if
anyon
want
to
talk
to
about
the
movi
befor
you
see
it
,
do
n't
let
them
.
let
the
director
explain
on
hi
own
pace
and
you
'll
enjoi
the
movi
vastli
more
.
i
'll
be
the
first
to
admit
i
did
n't
expect
much
from
the
emperor
's
new
groov
:
more
celin
dion-esqu
song-and-danc
number
,
cuddli
charact
that
becom
cross-promot
devic
in
mcdonald
's
happi
meal
,
and
hollywood
star
try
to
gain
credibl
by
ad
a
voic-over
job
to
their
resum
.
i
wa
dead
wrong
about
all
of
those
thing
.
the
emperor
's
new
groov
is
funni
.
damn
funni
.
and
the
cute
charact
in
the
film
ar
the
danger
on
.
the
script
is
fast
and
furiou
,
with
no
sing
and
danc
.
the
anim
is
clean
and
would
give
walt
a
warm
feel
all
over
.
the
humor
is
dry
and
aim
at
both
the
cynic
and
the
good
in
all
of
us
.
the
stori
is
ridicul
weird
and
come
off
as
a
strang
acid
trip
involv
talk
,
cross-dress
llama
and
schizophrenia
.
here
's
the
plot
;
try
to
follow
along

set
in
a
mythic
kingdom
,
the
film
follow
the
adventur
of
kuzco
(
david

)
,
an
arrog
and
egocentr
emperor
.
when
kuzco

hi
power-hungri

,
yzma
(
eartha
kitt
)
,
she
and
her
``
assist
``
kronk
(
seinfeld

patrick
warburton

chang
him
into
a
llama
.
kuzco
then
get

whose

to
be
replac

to

him

then
the

for

the

in

kitt
,
look
like
a
cross
between
norma
desmond
,
joan
crawford
,
and
a
realli
old
vega
showgirl
.
the
dialogu
between
her
and
her
oblivi
assist
kronk
is
quick
,
sharp
,
and
feel
like
an
episod
of

(
which
would
make

)
.
david
spade
and
john

's
charact
interact
make
you
feel
like
you

that
is
an

the

about

where

is
dure
it

shyamalan
ha

he

i

``
when

it

not

just
that

that
the

did

plu
,
it
almost
seem
like
it
set
itself
up
for
sequel
(
and
i
wo
n't

you
'll
understand
what
i

.
essenti
,
what
all
of
thi
mean
is
that
shyamalan
ha
made
anoth
good
film
with

the
onli
real
problem
is
that
the

doe
n't

fill
the
shadow
left
by

as
long
as
it
is
n't
held
to
the

which
it

will

)
,
it
should
be
a
remark
well
like

on
thing
seem
clear
,
though
.
shyamalan
definit
ha
an
affin
for
comic
book
that
he
would
like
to
share
with
the
world
and
mani
comic
book
fan
will
also
delight
the
vision
he
present
in
thi
film
.
there
's
good
new
and
bad
new
about
mulan
.
the
posit
is
that
disnei
ha
found
a
happi
medium
between
the
heavi-handed

is
that

that
main
charact
is
jeffrei

,
introduc
by
the

you

for

the
character

interest
enough
to
overcom

what
turn

to
be
a

it
's
here
that
the

seem

the

that

ye

it
ha
no

that

unsatisfi

if
thi
were

it
would
feel
complet
,

still

basic
the

but
thi
film
just
seem
to
end
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
be
stupid
and
suggest
an
altern
end

be

on

imagin
,
if
you
will
,
be
on
of
those
the
film
is
about
,
look
forward
to
thi
film
,
and
then
discov
the
truth
ha
been
through
a
surrealist

unpleas
hollywood
filter
,
just
so
the
mani
wo
n't
bitch
about
what
is
,
essenti
,
genuin

the
fact
that
it
just
end

not

in

,
what
is

with

it
's
rather
that

last
half
hour
,
to

the

stori
,
and
chose
the
other
part
of
hi
stori
,
the
on
about
the
lawyer
,
on
jan
schlictman
(
john
travolta
)
,
who
's
shown
in
the
open
and
throughout
most
of
the
movi
as
a
heartless
but
brilliant
lawyer
,
brilliant
becaus
he
's
manipul
and
he
alwai
win
.
it
wish
to
make
it
all
about
jan
in
the
end
,
but
the
truth
is
,
hi
chang
,
although
nice
done
,
is
not
full
.
we
see
him
suffer
from
a
person
crisi
,
and
travolta
doe
do
a
pretti
good
job
in
depict
hi
chang
of
heart
,
but
in
the
end
,
we
do
n't
fulli
believ
it
.
and
i
think
that
the
problem
is
when
he
ha
made
hi
decis
,
the
film
chose
an
odd
angl
to
go
at
,
a
nobl
on
,
but
on
that
give
the
film
's
conclus
that
of
incomplet
.
in
the
open
of
the
film
,
we
see
him
do
hi
old
schtick
,
manipul
court
,
win
case
effortlessli
,
and
then
discuss
on
a
heard
radio
interview
how
great
he
is
at
hi
job
and
how
much
he
care
for
hi
case
.
in
short
,
he
's
full
of
bullshit
and
we
know
it
.
in
the
film
,
he
take
a
case
that
is
hardli
desir
:
a
town
where
sever
of
the
children
have

thing
begin
to
go
downhil
for
the
lawyer
in
the
second
half
,
as
thei
ar
up
against
imposs
odd
:
the
judg
(
john

)
is
not
onli
a
strickler
,
but
a
pal
of
facher
;
the
employe

no

thei
ar

(

oh
,
``

)
,
and
we
the
audienc
begin
to
feel
a
real
loss
of
hope
for
our
protagonist
.
in
fact
,
the
last
half
hour
is
such
a
chang
from
the
rest
of
the
film
and
so
unresolv
that
it
ha
been
wide
pan
as
not
be
up
to
par
(

)
.
thi
would
n't
be
so
if
the
chang
in
jan
had
not
been
handl
the
wai
it
is
:
instead
of
have
a
chang
of
heart
and
automat
be
perceiv
as
good
,
he
's
seen
as
be
still
full
of
bullshit
.
becaus
he
doe
n't
take
stock
in
the
care
of
hi
partner
,
and
caus
them
all
to
lose
their
monei
and
noteriati
in
the
lawyer
field
becaus
he
want
to
help
the
peopl
of
the
town
,
he
is
instead
seen
as
be
of
good
natur
but
not
sure
how
to
bring
that
out
.
the
final
half
tri
to
redeem
thi
,
as
must
have
been
the
point
of
make
thi
in
zallian
's
mind
,
but
what
follow
is
a
seri
of
scene
where
we
mere
see
him
make
person
stand
for
hi
belief
,
and
though
he
ha
chang
consider
from
the
open
moment
when
he
's
seen
speed
back
and
forth
from
the
town
that
wish
to
emploi
him
(
and
thusli
receiv
two
speed
ticket
)
,
we
still
feel
that
the
big
chang
in
hi
life
is
that
he
's
not
rich
and
esteem
anymor
(
the
film
's
final
titl
card
is
witti
but
in
all
actual
shallow
)
.
the
fault
is
not
that
there
is
no
closur
to
the
court
case
(
it
's
still
go
on
,
you
know
)
,
but
that
it
person
stori
feel
like
it
need
either
anoth
chapter
or
anoth
angl
in
the
final
on
it
ha
.
we
need
to
feel
like
the
charact
ha
realli
made
a
big
chang
in
hi
life
,
and
that
the
stori
is
how
a
stori
of
strife
like
the
on
of
the
town
could
inspir
such
a
whop
chang
in
hi
person
life
.
it
onli
feel
like
half
of
that
.
mayb
even
less
.
and
it
's
not
travolta
,
who
doe
a
great
job
here
(
though
never
to
be
a
truli
memor
perform
of
hi
)
,
but
rather
zallian
,
whose
final
chapter
need
a
rewrit
.
up
to
then
,
though
,
it
's
an
engross
drama
,
on
of
the
best
of
the
year
in
fact
,
and
on
of
the
best
lawyer
film
,
period
.
the
reason
is
becaus
it
recogn
that
a
court
trial
is
not
about
those
be
defend
or
prosecut
,
but
rather
it
's
about
the
lawyer
,
the
knight
who
battl
eachoth
.
we
learn
that
the
compani
is
almost
posit
to
blame
for
the
death
in
the
town
,
but
the
reason
it
ca
n't
be
blame
is
becaus
it
ha
the
best
prosecut
you
can
find
.
and
duval
's
facher
is
such
a
brilliant
charact
and
he
doe
such
a
magnific
job
at
portrai
that
man
that
it
's
almost
easi
to
overlook
how
subtlei
great
he
is
.
facher
is
seen
as
an
elderli
man
,
a
goofi
eccentr
,
carri
a
broken
brown
bag
with
sticker
on
it
,
eat
lunch
out
of

,
and
make
a
point
to
take
time
out
of
hi
dai
to
listen
to
the
radio
,
and
scold
anyon
who
interupt
him
.
but
look
deeper
and
you
see
a
master
at
work
:
hi
evil
and
manipul
natur
ar
hidden
under
the
eccentr
that
other
don
upon
him
,
and
it
's
difficult
as
hell
to
clearli
gener
him
in
ani
wai
.
that
's
why
i
like
thi
film
:
it
's
hard
to
put
a
pointer
on
.
you
can
never

thi

(
in

most
of

take

veri

will

you

!
is
it
made
for

absolut
not
!
i
guess
you
can
describ
thi
film
as
a
horror
movi
for
the
``
cerebr

``

a
film
that
patient
unwrap

each

unwind

up

to

i
've
alwai
love
movi
that
have
me
talk
about
them
afterward
like

and
thi

fit
right
into

in

i
guess
i
can
pussyfoot
around
the
actual
word
all
i
want
but
the
best
wai
to
describ
thi
kind
of
movi
is
a
``
mindfuck
``
.
if
you
feel
like
watch
a
movi
that
move
veri
slowli
,
give
you
a
hand
of
charact
with
diverg

,
toss
a

veri
ambigu
and
supernatur
cooki
your
wai
and
is

onc
you
put

well

then
thi
movi
is
definit

it
's
the
kind
of

that
you
actual
have

(
damn
,
i
miss

on
that
will
like
creep
the
shit
out
of
you
if
watch
alon
in

``
brrrrrrrrr

.
.
now
what
wa
that

in

honei
,
can
you
go

``
and
on
thing
thi
film
doe
n't
have
,
unlik
it
hollywood-ian
counterpart
like
the
haunt
,
is
special
effect
.
in
fact
,
that
's
on
of
the
greater
thing
about
thi
movi
:
it
feel
real
becaus
it
look
like
it
's
actual
tape
on

with
veri
credibl
actor
in
veri
credibl
circumst
(
i
did
some
research
and
it
wa
,
in
fact
,
shot
on

.
.
.
ah-ha
!
)
.
anoth
great
thing
about
it
is
that
it
's
actual
veri
gori
and
somewhat
violent
in
theme

and
yet
we
rare
see
anyth

d
as

it
's
usual
much
scarier
when

thi
on

with

the

if

you
will
lose

thi

even
though
a
lot
of
critic
did
n't
like
the
film
,
i
love
it
.
the
director
took
hi
time
make
the
movi
,
and
put
a
lot
of
shadow
in
the
movi

i
found
it
not
to
be

at
all
and
it

come
from
some
predict

it
earn
it

to
be

to
me
that
's
what
it
wa

as

cinderella
ha
to
be
on
of
the
most
famou
.
almost
everyon
know
it
,
well
at

in
north
america
.
so
it
is
natur
that
someon
will
try
to
make
a
movi
out
of
it
.
it
ha
been
done
befor
with
vari
result
.
thi
version
of
the
stori
is
both
similar
to
the
origin
and
differ
at
the
same
time
.
the
basic
stori
remain
unchang
but
,
on
thing
that
seem
to
vanish
with
thi
version
,
and
that
is
all
the
fantast
element
of
the
stori
.
there
is
no
fairi
god
mother
or
anyth
even
remot
of
that
natur
.
after
the
fantast
element
ar
strip
awai
what
is
left
is
a
realist
believ
rendit
of
the
cinderella

daniel

on
a

most
coincident
and
he
becom
smitten

her
.
although
thi
seem
to
be
a

cry

tradit
stori
it

for
the
main

the
charact
of

plai
by
drew
barrymor
,
and
that
of
the
evil
step
mother
,
plai
by
anjelica
huston
,
ar
well
develop
and
well
plai
by
the
two
women
.
although
the
part
of
daniel
is
a
bit
stretch
it
is
not
too
unlik
and
not
total
unbeliev
.
the
nuanc
of
the
charact
ar
brought
out
well
by
drew
barrymor
and
from
watch
the
movi
it
seem
like
she
had
fun
make
the
movi
.
as
a
contrast
the
part
of
the
evil
step
mother
is
clearli
seen
from
the
veri
begin
and
is
almost
cliqu
.
but
,
anjelica
huston
seem
to
add
a
certain
flair
to
the
role
that
make
it
suit
the
movi
nearli
perfectli
.
the
actual
stori
is
fairli
predict
sinc
it
is
after
all
the
basic
stori
of
cinderella
,
but
there
ar
more
than
enough
twist
in
how
the
stori
is
told
to
make
it
interest
and
enjoy
.
the
act
is
of
high
calib
and
seem
deserv
of
prais
.
all
in
all
thi
movi
take
you
back
into
histori
,
into
a
seemingli
magic
fairi
land
.
but
,
do
n't
get
me
wrong
there
is
noth
but
realiti
,
it
is
just
refresh
to
watch
a
movi
that
is
not
base
in
a
familiar
set
with
everydai
familiar
thing
happen
.
so
although
the
stori
is
basic
familiar
the
world
it
is
set
in
is
not
,
and
that
add
a
dimens
to

seem

larri

is
in

with

,
the

of

,
introduc

set
up
the
charact
,
seem
unduli
rush
;
perhap
it
is
mere
due
to
the
fact
that
these
charact
ar
so
interest
,
but
i
felt
it
would
have
work
better
if
thi
rout
wa
taken
in
a
more
leisur
fashion
.
it
also
felt
like
there
wa
a
distinct
lack
of
insight
into
the
inner
work
of
these
charact
-
the
film
clearli
show
what
flynt

althea

jerri

did
,
and
on

some
of
their
motiv
,
but
it
never
seem
like
on
could
realli
understand
the
charact
on
a
deeper
level
.
for
exampl
,
why
larri
flynt
wa
compel
by
ruth
carter
stapleton
(
presid
carter

to
be
born-again
is
a

then
again

perhap
it
wa
to
him
as
well

these
two
point
do
n't
detract
greatli
from
the

the
peopl

larri

is
certainli
among
the
veri
best
studio-releas
film

work
both

the

is
the
stori
of

soul
achiev
in

ha
been

when
hi
own

result
in
a
no-show
for
the
bride
(

,
robbi
begin
to
re-examin
hi
life
,
and
wonder
why
true
love
doe
n't
exist
for
peopl
like
him
.
in
the
process
of
perform
at
these
recept
,
robbi
meet
a

,
plai
with
wholesom
sweet
by

barrymor
,
whose
reput
is
anyth

thi
charact

julia
too
is
engag
,
and
when
robbi
find
himself
without
a
wife
,
hi
free
time
allow
him
to
help
her
plan
her

the
``

love
glenn
(
matthew

,
doe
n't
seem
all
that
interest
.
as
the
time
goe
by
,
we
learn
the
reason
glenn
is
do
dispassion
about
the
wed
-
he
's
mere
marri
julia
to
prevent
a
breakup
,
someth
he
want
to
avoid
even
if
he
doe
sleep
around
with
ton
of
other
women
.
it
's
obviou
that
robbi
is
go
to
fall
for
julia
and
feel
a
strong
need
to
rescu
her
,
but
what
is
a

thi
is
n't

i
'd
actual
compar

i
'd
compar

sandler
is
great
in
hi
role
,
and
ye
,
if
you
allow
it
,
you
can
take
him
serious
.
barrymor
seem
perfect
along

him
,
and
although
the
two
more
like

the

it

for

ten
year

it

amaz

me
that
thi

ever
got
made

ha
had
the
stai
power
that
it
ha
.
if

had

i
do
n't
think
i
would
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
either
.
for
all
intent
and
purpos
it
is
a
bad
movi
(
though
bad
in

realli
good
sort
of
wai
)
,

sumptuou

increas

easi
to

it

most
popular
song
in
the
film
.
even
peopl
who
have
never
seen

know
of
that
particular
song
.
what
those
who
have
n't

do
n't
know
though
,
is
that
there
ar
even
more
song
in

ar
just
as
worthi
of
acknowledg

my

matthew

ar
a
complet

let
's
start
with
settl
.
matthew
is
complet
fake
in
thi
film
.
you
could
not
believ
a
word
come
out
of
hi
mouth
.
you
could
tell
he
wa
act
,
and
it
reason
like
him
that
thi
on
is
n't
as
good
as
the
first
on
.
he
doe
do
a
good
job
toward
the
end
,
but
that
doe
n't
clear
up
the
scar
he
alreadi
left
on
the
film
.
freddi
prinz
jr
.
is
almost
as
bad
as
matthew
settl
wa
.
he
is
almost
complet
unbeliev
,
and
the
major
of
hi
line
ar
complet
meaningless
and
out
of
place
.
we
do
n't
see
him
as
much
as
settl
,
otherwis
he
could
have
done
just
as
much
damag
as
settl
did
.
mekhi
phifer
is
alright
as
tyrel
,
but
yet
again
the
dialogu
is
out
of
place
.
the
plot
of
i
still
know
turn
out
to
be
a
pretti
good
on
at
the
end
of
the
movi
.
i
like
where
the
filmmak
went
with
thi
second
instal
,
but
mayb
if
it
occur
in
the
same
town
as
the
first
on
,
it
would
have
been
a
bit
better
.
the
cinematographi
and
set
of
their
island
ar
simpli
wonder
.
there
ar
a
lot
of
veri
nice
shot
around
their

the
sound
is

still

realli
pick

befor
thi

there
ar

he
had

if
the

it
could
have

it

have

the

the
part
of
jeff
``
the

lebowski
wa
reportedli
written
specif
with

in
mind
,
and
the
fit
is
perfect

the

:

the

it
is
an
incred

comedi

the
ratio
of

not

each

a
refresh

all
the
charact
end
up
as
the
butt
of
joke
,
but
the
joke
ar
alwai
deserv

never

each

there
is

never

it

it

the

so
whenev

appear

that

the

never

to

there
is
evid
both
for

the
most
scath
evid

come
from
a
scene
near

where
bateman
goe
on

kill

take
out
cop
,
old
ladi
,
and
clean

with
equal
gusto
.
the
scene
seem
veri
dream-like

as
absurd
as

suddenli
seem
to
be
parodi

i
kept

wake
up

for
the

to
continu
on
from
there
,
but
bateman
never
doe
wake
up
and
the
whole

,
though
comic
,
throw
the

off-balanc

these
ar

the
reason
rounder
still

is
becaus
it
is
less
about

it

about

we

he

is
gretchen

who
just
did
n't
seem

she
's
a
genuin
peach
to
look
at
,
kind
of
a

between

and
i
would

if
the
three
of

take

,
but
her
deliv
line
seem
veri
flat
,
and
i
found
myself
look
for
matt

instead
.
a
good
thing
about

is
that
it
doe
n't
get
bog
down
in

charact
develop
and
statement
make
so
much
that
it
ca
n't
find

the

is
pepper
nice
with
scene
that
both
make
you
laugh
and
keep

,
such
as
a

where

in

there
's
someth
about

is
the
best
film
that
i
will
see
all
year
.
from
the
moment
the
credit
start
to
roll
at
the
end
of
the
pictur
,
there
wa
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
had
seen
a
masterpiec
that
will
remain
unsurpass
in
the
remain
month
of
1998
.
it
is
that
good
of
a
film
.
when
gene
siskel
said
thi
about
``
fargo
``
onli
a
few
month
into
'96
,
i
dismiss
the
notion
as
ridicul
.
how
could
you
possibl
know
that
a
film
is
so
great
that
noth
you
could
possibl
see
in
the
futur
could
beat
it
?
but
after
see
the
farrelli
's
hilari
and
surprisingli
heartfelt
masterwork
,
i
now
know
what
siskel
wa
talk
about

onc
in

(

while
,
a

come
along
that
is
so
dare
,
so
brilliant
and
simpli
so
enjoy
that
at

you
just
want
to
stand
up
and

.
and
you
know
,
at
that
instant
,
that
you
have
just
experienc
someth
veri

now
for
the
shocker
;
``

the

heard

good
thing
about

though
the

did
n't
realli
intrigu
that
much
,
it
wa
a
movi
i
'd
been
anticip
for
a
few

now
.
for
some
reason
i
'm
not
sure
of
-
thi

wa
not
that
big
a

over
in

u

it
wa
a
definit
hit
with

did

after
view
thi
incred
well
direct
,
written
and
act
movi
,
i
ca
n't
help
but
wonder
-
why
?
the
strength
of
thi
film
is
it
's
gritti
realism
.
the
main
charact
ar
all
human
with
individu
flaw
,
no
stereo-type
hollywood
hero
.
you
mai
not
agre
with
mani
of
their
action
in
the
movi
or
their
approach
to
life
,
but
that
is
what
make
it
so
real
.
i
had
expect
thi
movi
to
be
more
of
a
drama
than
a
thriller
,
but
i
wa
mistaken
.
even
the
interrog
scene
move
at
such
a
pace
so
that
it
felt
just
as
thrill
as
ani
car
chase
.
and
the
end
.
.
.
.
.
.
whoa
.
i
've
never
seen
a

in
my
life
where
everyon
in
it
act
brilliantli
.
the
three
male
lead
-
gui
pearc

kevin
spacei
and
russel
crow
ar
all
just
terrif

the

thi

should
have
net
on
of
them
a

but
there
is
on
problem
there
.
how
could
thei
have
chosen
between
these
three
actor
?
there
is
no
wai
i
could
look
at
thi
film
and
sai
on
of
them
wa
better
than
the
other
two
.
it
's
imposs

kim
bassing
's
perform
is
also
a
revel
.
i
'd
never
been
a

of

alwai
thought
she
wa
,
well

what
's
the
word
-
a
twinki
?
that
impress
ha
chang
,
as
she
complement

pearc
perfectli
.
the
depth
to
the
stori
and
charact
is
truli
astound
.
no
cardboard
charact
here
.
the
plot
is
full
of
twist
and
turn
and
some
veri
clever
sequenc
.
pearc
's
interog
of
three
seper
suspect
is
noth
short
of
brilliant
.
i
realli
ca
n't
fault
thi

at
all
.
i
wa
so
glad
to
see

whether
it

the

of
thi

entertain
enough

also
quit
serious

the

simpl

the

i

everi

i

wild

it
is
so

take

that
the

just

the

i
found

in

she
appeal
to
such

for

all

the
basic
premis
is
the

as
everi

:
a

that
ar
the

i
have
a
feel
children

quickli

sinc
all
he
realli
is
is
just
a

want

it
's

how

fail

as

stori
transit
from

as

a
full-grown

(

there

braveheart
wa
onli
the
second
film
in
the
directori
career
by
mel
gibson
,
so
it
would
n't
be
fair
to
compar
it
to
the
better
known
genr
classic
direct
by
david
lean
or
anthoni
mann
.
howev
,
even
when
we
appli
such
criteria
braveheart
is
more
than
decent
histor
epic
that
take
new
and
refresh
approach
to
the
genr
.
the
most
notic
element
of
thi
approach
is
natur
.
while
older
hollywood
film
set
in
mediev
europ
us
to
give
fairytal-like
vision
of
picturesqu
castl
,
splendid
costum
and
knight
in
shine
armour
,
gibson
show
us
the
extrem
unpleas
world
of
poverti
and
feudal
injustic
where
might
made
right
and
life
wa
hard
,
short
and
brutish
.
thi
gener
unpleas
is
especi
underlin
in
the
scene
of
battl
,
where
hand-to-hand
combat
is
naturalist
displai
in
all
it
gori
detail
,
never
seen
sinc
verhoeven
's
ultra-naturalist
flesh
&
blood
.
compar
with
thi
naturalist
approach
,
most
of
old
hollywood
epic
look
like
stage
plai
.
braveheart
also
emploi
humour
at
the
right
place
,
not
onli
to
make
bloodi
realiti
of
mediev
british
isl
more
bearabl
to
sensit
audienc
,
but
also
to
underlin
it
down-to-earth
atmospher
,
so
differ
from
previou
histor
epic
.
what
make
braveheart
``
larger
than
life
``
is
hi
protagonist
.
mel
gibson
obvious
invest
plenti
of
hi
energi
and
talent
in
bring
the
mythic
figur
of
william

and
,
as
a
result
,
charact
of
15th
centuri
poem
is
transform
into
superhuman
be
that
resembl
late
20th
centuri
comic
book
hero
.
wallac
is
more
than
superior
to
hi
enemi
,
both
physic
and
mental
,
yet
he
is
abl
to
show
hi
sensit
,
more
vulner
side
.
natur
,
when
the
charact
is
base
on
epic
poem
,
most
of
histor
accuraci
is
go
down
the
drain
(
which
wa
the
case
with
almost
everi
histor
epic
from
hollywood
in

)
.
howev
,
even
those
who
do
n't
particularli
care
about
histori
or
ar
will
to
give
poetic
licens
to
scriptwrit
randal
wallac
might
think
that
he
went
over
the
top
in
idolis

,
especi
in

of
that
the

is
hardli
suspend
,
and
final
scene
ar
n't
as
effect

thei
should
be

mel

is
truli
wonder
,
and
he
is
also
help
by
small
armi
of
veri
good
british

irish

.
most
memor
of
them
all
is
patrick
mcgoohan
,
whose
cold
,
calcul
and
evil

is
on
of
the
most

but
she

from

photographi

bring
a
lot
of
scottish
natur
beauti
to

on
the
other
hand
,
the
music

emploi
too

piec

although
mostli

by
critic
and
audienc
alik
,
braveheart
wa
often
criticis
for
homophobia
and
other
form
of
extrem
conservat
.
the
main
reason
for
that
wa
the
fact
that
gibson
,
among

,
chose
to
be

onli
to
those
relat

orient
of
``

edward
(
plai

.
he
is
not
onli
present
as
a
villain
,
but
also
as
on
of
the
less
compet
in

's
camp
-
and
portrai
of
homosexu
as

or
inferior
to

is
almost
unforgiv
sin
in
``

``
hollywood
.
to
make
thing
even
more
obviou
,
good
gui
in
thi

ar
the

howev
,
although
the
messag

thi

might
look
right-wing
,
it
ow
more
to

accord
to
that
ideolog
,
oppress

ar
better
suit
to
fight
for

becaus
their
member
ha
less
to
lose
in
that
struggl
and
,
as
such
,
thei
ar
more
radic
,
less
will
to

more

;
on
the
other
hand
,
privileg

(

ar
more

thi
marxist
worldview
is
present

in

end
,
whether

enough
to

the

come
from
the

be

there
ar
no

distract

much
to
the
dismai

what
is
actual
portrai
is
the
lack
of

in
the
utopian
societi

iren
ha
no
real
spunk

rather
amaz
by

the

jerom

in
actual
a
bitter

what
jerom
ha
done
is
fool
the
system
in
give
a
man
who
yearn

a
chanc
at

the
end

the

be
stupid

we
see
that
as

i

admir
a

about

such
sincer
and
accept
that
the
cruel
stori
is
revers
to
near-sweet
and
further
strength
of
hi
sadden
charact

thornton
is
absolut
brilliant
in
thi
perform
,
by
far
the
best
perform
he
's
ever
given
and
further
proof
that
he
's
the
best
charact
actor
in
contemporari
cinema
(
if
you
do
n't
believ
me
,
go
back

watch
hi
wonder
perform

a
perform
that
would
have
been
nomin
for
an

if
thi
had
n't
been

)
becaus
he
's
easili
abl
to
slip
into
a
charact
,
and
make
him
complet

utterli
believ
.
he
bring
so
much
weight
to
the

that
,
as
it
is
with
most
charact
actor
,
it
's
difficult
pictur
anyon
els
in

the

of

even

show

.
and
if
i
had
ani
complaint
about
the
film
,
it
's
that
the
plot
is
almost
too
simplist
,
and
that
at
time
,
it
seem
too
much
like
an
exercis
,
like
a
cruel
test
on
human
that
still
pai
attent
to
the
human
involv
.
and
the
occasion
narrat
is
,
as
it
usual
is
,
annoi
(
narrat
should
be
us
with

caution
,

when

're

thing
up

emot
-
did
n't
raimi
watch
the
first
murder
scene
?
)
.
and
,
the
thing
that
can
most
usual
go
wrong
with
a
movi
,
the
end
is
basic
amiss
.
i
wo
n't
reveal
it
,
but
it
's
wai
too
cruel
and
too
much
of
an
outsid
set-up
,
as
if
the
appear
of
a
plane
wa
n't
alreadi
too
much
of
that
anywai
.
for
a
film
that
deal
so
much
and
so
intim
with
the
human
of
the
charact
involv
,
thi
is
the
wrong
end
.
imagin
a
charact-control
end
;
otherwis
,
it
's
like

in

a

so

and
vow
to

the
colonist
.
insurrect
is
a
lighter
movi
than
the
last
two
star

film
.
the
film
focus
on
the
lofti
question
of
whether
the
right
of
societi
as
a
whole
outweigh
the
right
of
a
small
group
.
in
thi
respect
it
get
back
to
the
root
of
star
trek
by
disguis
social
commentari
as
scienc
fiction
.
it
doe
n't
do
a
bad
job
,
other
than
it
tri
to
inject
too
much
humor
into
the
stori
line
.
mani
of
the
joke
ar
your
typic
insid
star
trek-fan-onli
joke
,
while
mani
of
the
other
just
fall
flat
.
the
other
critic
that
i
had
with
the
stori
wa
that
it
ignor
common
sens
.
there
ar
onli
a
few
hundr
peopl
on
thi
whole
planet
,
why
do
thei
have
to
be
move
?
the
explan
is
that
the
planet
ha
to
be
bombard
with
deadli
radiat
so
that
thi
fountain
of

effect
will
be
strong
enough
to

murrai
abraham

alien
who
number

a
coupl
of

.
so
the
basic
stori
line
is
bad
enough
in
that
we
have
a
few
hundr
be
boot
out
for
a
few
billion
,
at
least
that
's
plausibl
.
but
in
realiti
we
have
a
few
hundr
be
move
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
dozen
,
which
make
no
sens
whatsoev
.
the
other
littl
hiccup
in
logic
is
the
inclus
of
worf
(
michael
dorn
)
,
the
trusti
klingon
.
worf
wa
on
star
trek
:
the
next
gener
,
so
thei
want
to
includ
him
in
the
film
.
no
problem
so
far
.
worf
is
now
a
charact
of
star
trek
:
deep
space
nine
,
so
the
writer
have
to
find
a
wai
to
have
him
show
up
.
in
the
last
star
trek
movi
,
first
contact
,
the
includ
worf
in
a
credibl
fashion
,
in
thi
on
,
the
writer
ar
so
lazi
that
the
complet
gloss
over
why
he
is
even
in
the
movi
.
what
littl
explan
thei
do
give
is
so
small
that
you
would
have
miss
it
if
you
were
n't
hang
on
everi
word
on
the
screen
.
my
minor
problem
with
the
movi
asid
,
star
trek
:
insurrect
doe
have
an
overwhelm
number
of
good
point
as
compar
to
it
bad
on
.
while
mani
of
the
joke
do
miss
the
mark
,
mani
ar
pretti
good
,
even
for
non-trekki
.
the
special
effect
ar
among
the
best
for
the
star
trek
seri
.
the
action
is
plenti
and
well
done
.
thi
is
a
veri
good-look
movi
.
it
should
come
as
no
surpris
to
anyon
who
ever
watch

:
the
next

that
the
act
is

it
is

that

thei

most

i

not

how
would

the

the
score
from

wa
also
neat
;
it
remind
me
a
bit
of
the
lion
king
,
but
it
wa
more
origin
.
so
,
the
soundtrack
wa
n't
bad
at

,
consid
it
wa
by
two
peopl
i
am
not

thi

could
be

will
it
be

is
that
it

that
air

an

is
it
?
i
had

to
see
thi

after

so
on

i
wa
not

i
found
it

went
back

it

that
my

such
a
deeper

perspect
than
i
had
previous
experienc

it
is
a
far
too
feasibl
misconcept
that
thi
is
a

which
forward
the
idea
that
a
world
without
some
``

is
not
a

at

instead
,
the
actual
messag
,
which
so
far
ha
not
been
recogn
by

that
i

,
is
that
a
world
without

doe
n't
give
on
the
abil
to
discern
right
and
wrong
for
himself
,
becaus
everyth
is

right

there
is
no
room
for
mistak

becaus
there
ar
no
mistak
to
be
made
,
no
space
for

and
never
anyth

to
learn
,
and
that
is
the
kei

that
is

a

is
not
john

perform

a
strong
on
that
could
rival
ani
perform
in
1998
.
travolta
prove
that
a

and
believ
perform
can
vault
a
film
into
oscar
nomin

hi
perform
is
not
flashi
,
nor
memor
,
just
solid
.
if

deliv

thi

would
still

luckili

he

william

he
continu

he
is
still
regard
as
a
secondari
actor

in
a

,
he
deliv
yet
anoth
great
perform
as
travolta
's
paranoid
and
greedi
account
.
he
is
not
a
lovabl
charact
,
but
a
charact
who
stand
out
in
your
mind
whenev
you
think
of

he
is
not
on
of

just
a

,
he
deliv
on
of
the
best
support

of
1998
,
but
there
is
actual
someon
better
in

.
robert
duval

also
an
underr

he
get

is

my

the
action
sequenc
ar
noth

thi
can
be

much
to

it

laurenc

on
the

often

under

he
made
the
most
with
what
he
had

carri-ann
moss
turn
out
a
surprisingli
good
perform
for
thi
her
first
featur
film
role
.
it
's
nice
to
see
that
she
wa
cast
as
much
for
her
talent
as
for
her
breathtak
look
.
you
have
to
give
all
of
the
main
actor
a
healthi
dose
of
credit
for
the
work
that
thei
obvious
put
into
the
physic
train
for
their
role
in
thi
film
.
it
wa
clear
that
no
small
effort
went
into
get
the
move
down
perfectli
for
the
fight
sequenc
.
i
also
put
much
of
the
blame
for
the
somewhat
strain
perform
in
the
matrix
on
the
dialogu
,
which
wa
terribl
at
time
.
in
more
than
a
few
place
it
got
wai
too
existenti
for
my
like
and
at
other
time
it
wa
just
plain
weird
.
it
almost
seem
as
though
the
writer
were
have
a
difficult
time
try
to
figur
out
how
to
explain
the
concept
for
the
movi
.
so
thei
decid
to
make
the
dialogu
as
obtus
as
possibl
so
that
no
on
could
figur
out
what
the
heck
thei
were
talk
about

therebi
cover
up
ani
leap
of
faith
that
thei
mai
have
had
to
make
in
the
depart
of
logic
and
believ
.
my
other
major
complaint
with
the
matrix
wa
with
the
veri
unsatisfi
end
.
the
setup
for
it
wa
hokei
and
frankli
us
in
mani
a
bad

befor
.
the
end
itself
wa
just
plain
strang
.
the
main
reason
to
recommend
the
matrix
ar
the
visual
effect
and
comput
anim
which
make
thi
a
real
treat
to
watch

rest
of

thei
do

detract

so
intrigu

charact
also
get
the
best
laugh
in

,
toward

end
in
a
diner
.
the
convers
that
go
on
between
mike

ar
great
,
but
it
never
quit
reach
tarantino
standard
(
which
i
suspect
the
film
wa
try

reach
.
)
there
ar
some
excel

laugh
out
loud

in

there
charact
seem

we
never

thi
is
primarili
mike

it
would
of
been

to
learn
a

more
about

thei
just
seem

wander
aimlessli
in

but
again
,
the
line
thei
sai
ar
usual
pretti
good
,
and
thei
do
have
some
funni
part
.
it
's
just
a
shame
that
thei
did
n't
have
more
meatier

the
act
is
superb
.
as
said
abov
,
vaughn
is
superb
as
trent
,
he
's
definit
the
best

favreau

,
then
,
is
funni
,
but
it
doe
have
some
flaw
.
firstli
,
the
run
time
is
a
bit
too
short
.
the
film
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
,
and
i
actual
want
the
film
to
carri
on
longer
.
it
never
realli
come
to
a
satisfi
conclus
,
which
is
a
shame
,
as
most
film
ar
too
long
!
also
,
thi
type
of
film
ha
been
done
too
mani
time
,
such
as
sleep
with
me
(
1994
)
.
but
these
small
flaw
do
n't
realli
spoil
what
is
a
funni
,
entertain
comedi
.
a
frequent
error
is
the
categor
of
a
terrorist
as
a
soldier
or
a
common
crimin
.
a
soldier
commit
act
of
violenc
sanction
by

against

a
common
crimin
commit
act
of
violenc
for
person
gain
.
a
terrorist
emploi
random
violenc
as
a
mean
to
a
polit
end
.
if
the
target
nation
doe
not
affect
the
desir
chang
in
polici
,
the
violenc
continu
.
it
is
the
fear
result
from
the
fact
that
the
terrorist
mai
strike
at
anyon
(
even
total
innoc
)
,
anywher
,
at
anytim
that
give
the
figur

edward

the
possibl
of

kind
of

take

right

admittedli
,
the

,
but
the
basic
premis
is
still
valid
.
i

the

that
thi

abov

of

some
of

it
provid
a

that

of
a

arab
would
escal
into
a
seri
of
hate

against

and
that
in
an
effort
to
find
the

,
the
civil
liberti

mai
be
violat
by

in

about
halfwai

when

citi
,
the
liberti

put

although
it
mai
actual
be
a
side
effect
of
a

campaign
,
the
demis
of

in

is
a
scari
thought
and
a
goal
which
would
not
be
beneath

throughout

the

maintain
a

all
thei
care
about
is
get

thi
is
on
of
the
mani
reason
that
the

funni

it
's
unbeliev
just
how
stupid
thei

and
how
thei

the

crude

then
beavi

ar
just
that
;
crude

lude

rude

in

you

let
me
start
off
by
sai
that
lead
up
to
the
releas
of
the
latest
bond
film
,
i
realli
wa
n't
look
forward
to
it
as
much
as
i
have
with
some
of
the
previou
film
.
i
'm
not
sure
if
it
wa
the
fairli
lacklust
trailer
or
the
ever-present
dread
that
the
next
film
will
fall
back
into
the
miser
wai
of
the
timothi
dalton
year
.
i
'm
happi
to
report
that
ani
doubt
were
eras
after
about
the
first
10
minut
of
the
film
.
by
that
point
,
it
wa
evid
that
mr
.
bond
wa
back
with
a
vengeanc
.
all
doubt
would
have
probabl
been
eras
sooner
except
for
the
fact
that
the
first
ten
minut
of
the
film
were
n't
exactli
a
pleasant
experi
.
it
seem
that
nobodi
told
the
genius
work
at
the
theater
that
the
hous
light
ar
suppos
to
be
turn
off
when
the
movi
start
.
it
took
a
remind
from
an
audienc
member
to
clue
them
in
.
i
guess
thei
can
be
excus
though
,
take
ticket
and
clean
up
popcorn
between
show
is
extrem
tax
on
the
brain
.
anywai
,
after
somebodi
rememb
what
the
light
switch
wa
for
,
i
settl
in
for
bond
.
i
think
the
most
notic
aspect
of
thi
,
the
19th
film
in
the
seri
,
is
that
it
realli
goe
back
to
the
almost
tongu
in
cheek
style
of
the
roger
moor
film
.
there
were
probabl
more
on-liner
in
thi
movi
than
in
the
last
sever
combin
.
and
bond
's
last
on-liner
in
the
film
is
about
the
best
of
the
seri
.
the
world
is
not
enough
also
contain
perhap
the
most
action
of
ani
movi
of
the
seri
.
everyth
from
wild
boat
chase
to
the
usual
assort
of
cool
bond
gadget
trot
out
just
when
there
seem
to
be
no
wai
out
for
007
.
for
the
most
part
,
the
action
sequenc
work
veri
well
.
although
,
there
were
a
coupl
of
time
that
i
thought
some
thing
were
a
bit
over
the
top
,
even
for
a
bond
film
.
i
think
some
of
the
blame
can
be
laid
at
the
feet
of
director
michael
apt
.
while
he
did
a
good
job
for
the
most
part
,
there
were
point
in
the
movi
,
specif
dure
action
sequenc
,
that
he
seem
to
loos
site
of
the
fact
that
he
wa
make
essenti
an
action
film
.
most
notic
sequenc
on
a
snow
cover
mountain
and
on
involv
bond
get
through
a
close
door
look
like
apt
thought
he
wa
film
some
sort
of
high
brow
art
movi
.
he
almost
seem
like
he
did
n't
know
what
he
wa
do
.
but
thei
were
brief
scene
and
realli
should
n't
take
awai
from
the
otherwis
solid
job
that
apt
did
in
direct
.
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
bond
film
,
you
wo
n't
be
shock
to
learn
that
plot
ha
never
been
their
strong
suit
.
the
world
is
not

no

thi

a

a
bullet
lodg
in

that
make
him
impervi
to
pain
.
why
thi
point
is
includ
is
beyond
me
.
thei
took
great
pain
to
explain
hi
condit
,
but
it
onli
came
up
later
in
the
movi
as
a
scene
that
can
onli
be
describ
as
look
like
an
afterthought
.
anywai
,
renard
,
like
the
typic
terrorist
that
he

is
bent
on
some

bond
is
brought
in
to
protect
the

elektra

,
who
is
the

of
on
of

ha
to
enlist

dr
.
christma
jone
(
denis
richard
)
,
and
hi
old
rival
valentin
zukovski
(
robert
carlyl
)
.
like
all
bond
film
,
you
basic
just
have
to
suspend
disbelief
over
the
plot
,
sinc
it
is
ridicul
beyond
word
.
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
that
it
wa
about
the
most
disjoint
of
ani
of
the
bond
film
.
there
wa
at
least
on
point
that
i
had
to
stop
and
try
to
rememb
why
bond
wa
where
he
wa
and
why
he
wa
do
what
he
wa
do
.
the
buddi
that
i
saw
the
movi
with
wa
complet
confus
over
an
earlier
kidnap
of
marceau
's
charact
.
it
wa
allud
to
earlier
in
the
movi
briefli
--
although
not
includ
in
the
film
.
later
,
it
becam
a
big
part
of
the
stori
and
left
him
with
the
distinct
feel
that
he
had
miss
someth
.
but
becaus
it
is
a
bond
film
,
the
beauti
women
and
nifti
gadget
seem
to
make
you
forget
about
script
problem
quit
quickli
.
after
all
,
it
is
n't
shakespear
.
how
about
the
cast
?
brosnan
seem
to
get
better
with
each
of
hi
appear
as
007
.
i
grew
up
with
the
roger
moor
version
of
bond
,
so
i
realli
enjoi
the
lighter
style
that
brosnan
bring
to
the
charact
.
judi
dench
,
as
m
,
had
a
bigger
role
in
thi
film
than
in
her
two
previou
appear
in
the
role
.
she
brought
the
talent
with
her
that
on
would
expect
from
an
oscar
winner
.
robbi
coltran
wa
easili
on
of
the
best
part
in
goldeney
,
so
it
wa
nice
to
see
hi
russian
mobster
charact
reviv
in
thi
movi
.
coltran
get
more
screen
time
,
which
simpli
lead
to
him
steal
even
more
scene
.
then
there
ar
the
bond
girl
.
sophi
marceau
might
be
on
of
the
most
beauti
actress
work
todai
.
there
is
just
someth
about
her
breathtak
ey
that
make
her
a
natur
to
plai
the
innoc
victim
.
those
that
saw
her
in
braveheart
know
she
is
more
than
just
a
pretti
face
.
marceau
mai
be
the
most
talent
actress
to
ever
plai
a
bond
love
interest
.
then
we
have
denis
richard
.
there
wa
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
she
wa
cast
exclus
for
her
look
.
and
after
you
see
the
outfit
she
wear
,
you
wo
n't
have
ani
troubl
guess
what
part
of
her
anatomi
caught
the
produc
's
ey
.
i
wa
pleasantli
surpris
to
find
that
she
realli
did
a
good
job
plai
a
nuclear
scientist
.
admittedli
,
there
wa
on
point
that
the
audienc
snicker
a
bit
at
on
of
her
technic
line
of
dialogu
,
but
other
than
that
she
stack
up
(
no
pun
intend
)
to
her
bond
girl
predecessor
nice
.
i
must
sai
that
the
biggest
disappoint
wa
robert
carlyl
's
charact
.
while
carlyl
did
a
fine
job
with
the
materi
that
he
had
,
hi
charact
just
never
work
for
me
.
the
produc
tri
veri
hard
to
add
more
complex
to
hi
charact
,
but
it
just
never
quit
got
off
the
ground
.
i
guess
i
wa
hope
for
a
bit
more
regard
the
whole
impervi
to
pain
aspect
of
hi
charact
,
but
the
writer
decid
to
plai
up
the
emot
side
of
hi
charact
.
thi
might
have
work
well
in
anoth
movi
,
but
i
do
n't
go
to
see
bond
movi
for
their
deep
character
.
last
,
but
not
least
,
we
have
desmond
llewelyn
as
q
.
thi
is
the
17th
appear
for
llewelyn
as
bond
's
gadget
gui
,
and
he
is
as
good
as
ever
.
although
hi
screen

ha
grown

more

in

he
is
still
a
treat
to

rumor
abound
that
thi
mai
be
hi
last
appear
in
the

.
he
sai
futur
appear
ar
up
to
a

.
the

have
introduc
hi
proteg
and
futur
replac
,
a
bumbl
and
somewhat
pompou
charact
plai
by
comedi
master
john
clees
.
while
we
do
n't
see
much
of
him
in
thi
film
,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
sai
that
desmond
llewelyn
's
legaci
,
whenev
it

it

,
even

modern

than

,
from

the
biggest
debat

whether

not

``

on

is
the

whether

but
to
just
state
thi
is
arbitrari

and
explain

the

is
difficult

labut
's
abil

but
what
's

the
fact
the

for

anoth

the

everi

take
place
insid
with

we
're
alwai
abl
to
tell
where
the

(

the

a

what

is

the

is
a

with
the
tight
,
intens
drama
of
the

.
no
on
plot
domin
the
stori
,
which
make
the
first
act
a
bit
tediou
for
it
lack

background
.
we
're
simpli
drop
in
on
the
charact
'
live
and
ar
expect
to
figur
out
the
rest
.
the
charact
ar
a
group
of
middl-class
white
peopl
who
ar
all
success
at
what
thei
do
,
but
thei
're
onli
concern
right
now
seem
to
be
their
sex

first
there
's
barri

,
a

mani
other
coupl
in
other
situat
who
do
n't
know
what
thei

barri
is
kind
of
a
dorki
businessman
who
love
hi
wife
,
and
the
sex
thei
have
,
but
doe
n't
have
a
lot
of

-
he
just
follow
everyon

.
mari
is
a
writer
of
some
sort
,
but
lack
aggress
and
emot
like
her
husband
and
is
the
meek
charact
,
but
iron
,
doe
n't
hesit
to
commit

just
to
feel
someth
.
labut
's

in

mari
and
barri
as
individu

but
is
veri
light
on
chemistri
and
connect
between
the
two
.
obvious
,
thi
is
the
theme
,
which
is
enhanc
by
the
actor
'
good
perform
,
but
at
the
same
time
seem
just
a
bit
hollow
.
anoth
coupl
is
jerri

and
terri
(

who
live
togeth

seem

have

thei
constantli
argu

anyth

everyth

their

life
is
also
fraught
with
problem
and
for
some
reason
thei
continu

do
it
throughout

if
onli
on

it
would
be
thi

it
's
natur
for

why
would
two

each

continu

togeth
?
what
did
thei
ever
see
in
the

to
begin
with
?
labut
never
realli
answer
,
but
sinc
the
film
is
more
concern
with
the
payoff
than
the
process

it

that
we

cheri
is
a
charact
labut
us
as
a
catalyst
to
see
how
the
other
charact
react
to
her
.
she
work
in
an
art
museum
and
at
some
point
throughout
the
film
,
each
charact
will
engag
her
in
almost
the
exact

convers
and
her
reaction
is
alwai
differ

from
becom
involv
in

with
on

to
brush
it
off
as
small
talk
with
anoth

to
be
outright
appal
by
yet
anoth
.
she
's
a
sweet
woman
,
perhap
the
most
normal
of
ani
of
the
charact
,
and
although
her
symbol
is
obviou
,
her
role
as
the
outsid
is
the
most
relat
.
i
will
not
reveal
who
cheat
on
who
and
how
each
charact
is
specif
affect
by
the
other
'
action
,
as
that
's
the
hook
of
the
film
.
the
first
two
act
begin
to
set
up
the
charact
and
each
's
scenario
,
but
it
's
often
difficult
to
tell
what
thei
will
do
about
it
and
with
whom
.
the
result
is
sometim
surpris
,
other
time
predict
,
but
the
actual
cours
of
action
is
alwai
fascin
.
for
a
while
everyon
ha
their
fun
,
but
ultim
each
charact
's
guilt
,
attitud
,
or
ignor
will
disserv
them
.
on
of
the
most
import
thing
to
note
is
how
realist
the
stori
is
suppos
to
be
.
sinc
the
charact
onli
interact
with
each
other
there
is
n't
much

as
almost
everyth
ha
a

ar
we
to
assum
that
these

as
the

our

i
do
n't

what

i
hate
to
do
thi

last

got
it
damn
perfect

it
cast

is
cold

cut
off

then
pull

watch

the
result
wa
not

a

also
the

thi

so
he
gener
doe
n't
have

except
that

find

have
resolv

the

would
seem
forc

for

i
felt

wai
the

of

did

mayb
it

lovabl

wai
you
just

push

that
make
you
realiz
you
have
true

and
these

ar

not
to
mention
kenneth
branagh
is
abl
to
make
the
film
seem
nostalg
for
the
80s
(
a
decad
i
grew
up
in

unfortun

without
take
us
outsid
of

there
ar
some

thi
is
the
british

're
talk
about

is
pretti
good

noth
amaz

realli
make

at

he
's
veri
good
with
make
a
less

the
write
is
good

of

a
littl
note
should
be
made
about
hugh

as
he
look

he
took
some
massiv
dose
of

astound

certainli
on
of
the
best
film
of
1997
,
``
the
sweet

``
is
a
deepli
reward
,
mystifi
,
and
ultim
human
film
.
when
i
first
heard
about
scream
in
1996
,
i
wa
told
that
it
wa
a
spoof
of
horror
movi
.
from
the
master
of
the
horror
himself
,
we
craven
,
it
ridicul
the
clich
of
the
genr
by
overemphas
them
,
by
make
the
teenag
do
what
thei
know
thei
're
not
suppos
to
do
when
a
serial
killer
is
stalk
them
(
do
n't
run
up
the
stair
when
you
can
easili
go
out
the
front
door
,
never
sai
``
i
'll
be
right
back
,
``
etc
.
)
.
when
i
first
heard
thi
descript
,
i
figur
that
it
wa
an
easi
wai
out
of
make
a
bad
movi
.
how
hard
is
it
to
make
an
extrem
terribl
film
but
claim
it
is
actual
a
mockeri
of
other
bad
movi
.
wa
thi
we
craven
's
remedi
from
make
``
real
``
bad
movi
such
as
vampir
in
brooklyn
?
it
just
seem
cheap
to
me
.
then
i
actual
saw
the
movi
and
the
first
twenti
minut
,
involv
drew
barrymor
and
a
nail-bitingli
intens
phone
convers
,
complet
chang
my
attitud
.
scream
is
not
onli
a
clever
parodi
of
your
standard
horror
flick
,
it
's
also
a
pretti
scari
movi
.
if
you
've
seen
a
million
of
these
kind
of
film
,
you
know
exactli
what
is
go
to
happen
.
thi
is
part
of
the
fun
of
watch
scream
.
the
movi
remind
avid
horror
fan
how
similar
and
repetit
the
genr
is
and
it
also
remind
them
how
great
a
guilti
pleasur
it
can
be
to
watch
pointless
and
predict
violenc
to
innoc
,
attract
teenag
.
to
those
who
rare
see
these
type
of
movi
,
scream
is
a
thrill
unpredict
ride
that
could
be
mistaken
as
a
seriou
slasher
film
.
there
's
noth
wrong
with
that
misjudg
though
.
i
have
wit
viewer
from
both
side
of
the
audienc
,
the
newbi
to
horror
and
the
fanat
.
their
opinion
on
the
film
were
so
differ
but
both
veri
posit
.
from
these
vari
review
,
i
am
convinc
that
scream
ha
not
onli
reviv
the
teen
horror
movi
and
the
normal
teen
romanc
movi
but
also
the
hilari
parodi
of
these
and
other
categori
.
film
that
both
derid
and
celebr
genr
like
galaxi
quest
and
the
big
hit
would
not
have
exist
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
it
wa
not
for
the
outstand
success
of
scream
.
the
low
-
budget
1996
gem
mai
,
alongsid

,
be
the
most
influenti
film
of
the
1990
's
.
thi
influenc
mai
exist
to
the
chagrin
of
some
moviego
who
despis
movi
like
teach
mr
.
tingl
or
televis
program
such
as
dawson
's
creek
but
to
other
such
as
myself
,
we
congratul
the
movi
that
ha
open
new
door
for
excel
young
actor
,
screenwrit
,
and
director
.
scream
is
also
an
extrem
funni

to
it

kevin

within
the
film
ar
charact

tell

charact
,
as
well
as
the
audienc
,
the
basic
rule

mainli
from
the
rant
of
randi
(
jami
kennedi
)
and
stu
(
matthew
lillard

,
we
ar
remind
not
onli
of
the
obviou
and
hilari
rule
but
also
some
of
the
more
subtl
stereotyp
that
when
thought
over
ar
mostli
true
as
well
(
the
virgin

.
not
onli
ar
we
treat
these
rule
on
a
plate
but
also
the
rule
ar
referenc
to
a
number
of
differ
film

actor

the

feel

an

geek
who
ha
noth

to
do
but
find
everi

a

that
's

it

with

as

;
then
come
the
stori
of
an

then
we
see
the

of

who

it

the

howev
,
it

i

-
a

analysi
of

up

would
indic
that
all

thi
is

it

i
realli
should

anyth

about

let
me
add
that

also
inconsist

prevent

it
doe
n't

move

thei
're

of

,
and
by

,
it
ha
lost

as
she
take

,
we
ar
unabl
to
truli
identifi

but
despit
it
tedious
,
perhap
that
's
the
point
.
the
distanc
by
the
end
of
the

mai
be
just
part
of

wai
it

been

from

,
sinc
thei
figur
she
ha
cross
over
from

identifi
,
and
it
need
to
get
back
with

.
and
for
the
most
part
,
thi
film
seem
like
the
cry
of
pain
from
the
slave
that
it
realli
want
to
be
.
jonathan
demm
's
direct
is
bizarr
,
in
natur
with
the
stori
,
and
he
creat
the
right
mood
,
make
it
a
tough
film
to
sit
through
,
make
sure
that
the
audienc
feel
as
uncomfort
as
the
charact
.
there
's
more
to
admir
here
,
like
the
wai
that
the
flashback
pop
up
freeli
and
without
real
organ
,
just
like
thei
would
be
in
real
life
;
and
the
wai
that
the
end
leav
it
somewhat
open
to
more
pain
and
suffer
,
but
lace
with
a
touch
of
optim
.
the
act
,
not
onli
from

,
is
amaz
,
and
i
anticip
not
onli
she
will
get
an

everyon

been
rave
about
thandi

perform
,
and
how
it
should
be

.
howev
,
it
must
be
note
that
out
of
everyon
,
she
had
the
easiest

.
act
like
a
babi
.
throw

stumbl

chew

with
your

open

i
do
think
there
's
anoth
perform
worthi
of

it
's

sane
,
and
ha
to
carri
the
burden
of
her
mother
's
loss
of

toward
the

.
it
's
not
that
newton
is
n't
great
:
she
's
as
annoi
and
wacki
as
the

it
's
just
that
elis
ha
the
tougher

and
pull

off
even
better

despit
the

that
thi

my
singl

minor
complaint
about

that

there

miss

my
quibbl
is
not

what
is
import
is
that
i
acknowledg
the
qualiti

thi
pictur

the
sheer
skill
with
which
it
ha
been
written
,
act

shakespear

tri
so
mani
thing
,
and
nail
everi
on
of
them
:
it
's
a
film
that
both
love
shakespear
and
make
fun
of
him
,
a
film
in
which
the
actor
,
writer
,
and
director
ar
all
perfectli
in
sync
.
it
's
also
a
movi
that
ha
the
potenti
to
introduc
a
lot
of
peopl
to
shakespear
's
work
in
a
posit
wai
,
without
seem
condescend
or
superior
.
i
admir
thi
film
not
onli
becaus
it
pass
so
pleasantli
,
but
becaus
it
ha
lofti
aspir
and
succe
in

not
just
ani
film
can
poke
fun
at

get

let

i
knew
thi

,
after
the
brilliantli
shot
and
act

off

the
act
throughout

is
staggeringli
good
for
an

i
've
never

it

.
.
.
.
not
a
common
mix
at
all
.
suspens
of
disbelief
is
paramount
in
thi
movi
though
.
.
.
.
.
that
's
the
onli
wai
to
overlook
the
fact
that

the
part
where

and

have
a
stand
off
on

mirror
is
just
plain

john
travolta

veri
young
olivia
newton-john
have
the
respect
lead
of
danni
zuko
and
sandi
olsson
,
and
their
pair
still
rank
as
on
of
screendom
's
most
effervesc
charm
.
for
those
eight
of
you
who
ar
n't
familiar
with
the
stori
,
here
's
a
brief
recap
:
greaser
bad
boi
danni
and
aussi
good
girl
sandi
ar
reunit
for
their
1959
senior
year
at
rydel
high
after
a
brief
fling
dure
the
summer
;
both
thought
she
wa
go
to
return
to
her
nativ
contin
befor
school
start
,
but
both
were
wrong
.
sandi
tri
to
rekindl
their
relationship
,
but
danni
's
too
cool
a
cat
to
fall
for
her
wholesom
appeal
in
front
of
hi
t-bird
buddi
(
includ
jeff
conawai
)
.
so
sandi
hook
up
with
a
gang
herself
--
the
pink
ladi
,
head
by
sassi
,
sexi
rizzo
(
stockard
chan
,
just
superb
as
an
independ
woman
well
ahead
of
her
time
)
--
and
danni
,
who
still
realli
feel
love
for
her
,
attempt
a
compromis
of
ideal
in
order
to
win
her
back
.
the
drag
race
final
is
yet
someth
of
a
drag
,
and
i
never
have
thought
much
of
``
greas
lighten
,
``
the
film
's
big
``
gui
``
number
(
that
choreographi
--
ack
!
)
,
but
``
greas
``
's
flaw
amount
too
few
to
carp
.
the
movi
's
first
showpiec
is
``
summer
night
,
``
where
danni
and
sandi
separ
recount
wildli
differ
version
of
their
fun-in-the-sun
romanc
.
not
onli
is
``
night
``
tremend
catchi
,
but
it
's
also
a
smart
look
at
how
men
and
women
see
the
same
event
with
vari
ey
.
there
ha
yet
to
be
a
live-action
music
sequenc
that
rival
the
on-two
punch
of
``
you
're
the
on
that
i
want
``
and
``
we
go
togeth
,
``
``
greas
``
's
euphor
capper
.
all
thi
and
some
of
the
most
pleas
moment
come
from
the
smaller
,
quieter
moment
;
the
oscar-nomin
``
hopelessli
devot
to
you
``
is
a
love
showcas
for
newton-john
,
and
chan
's
lament
ballad
``
there
ar
wors
thing
i
could
do
``
is
on
of
``
greas
``
's
most
unjustli
overlook
tune
.
the
soundtrack
is
remast
(
though
travolta
still
hit
that
aw
high
note
at
the
end
of
``
night
``
)
and
the
restor
widescreen
allow
us
to
see
previous
pan-and-scan-out
choreographi
,
but
noth
els
ha
chang
--
no
comput-gener
background
,
no
outtak
or
new
music
number
,
no
jabba
the
hutt
cameo
.
and
it
's
a
testament
to
``
greas
``
's
timeless
success
that
noth
need
to
be
chang
--
it
's
the
same
all-around
blast
it
's
alwai
been
,
with
an
appeal
cast
in
a
fun
stori
told
with
great
music
.
to
'90s
viewer
,
``
greas
``
will
probabl
recal
disco
and
bellbottom
as
much
as
it
made
it

nostalg

but
regardless
of
what
decad
it
transport

to
,
we
can
all
agre
on
on
thing
--
without
a
doubt
,
``
greas
``
is
still
the
word
.

onc

the

dreamwork
versu

earlier
thi

the

the
death
with
their
end-of-the-world

deep

here
we
ar
now
,
just
a

and
thei
're
at
it
again
with
duel
bug
movi
,
antz
and
a
bug
's

.
what
i
find
so
astonish
is
that
both
pair
of
movi
ar
so
inher
similar
in
both
stori
and
execut
.
i
mean
,
come
on
--
what
were
the
chanc
of
two
studio
both
decid
to
bring
out
comput-anim
film
about

as
wa
the
case
with
the
meteor
movi
,
disnei
ha
come
out
on
top
:
though
antz
is
a
likabl
movi
,
a
bug
's
life
is
far
superior
.
in
fact
,
thi
movi
made
me
realiz
what
wa
wrong
with
antz
:
i
becam
immers
in
the
world
of
a
bug
's

,
while
antz
just
made
me
scrutin
everyth
.
but
it
's
not
realli
fair
to
base
an
entir
review
on
a
comparison
.
a
bug
's
life
is
a
remark
film
in
it
own
right
,
and
deserv
to
be
seen
apart
from
ani
other
comput-anim
film
about
bug
.
in
fact
,
it
's
on
of
the
best
film
thi
year
:
it
's
smart
,
subtl
,
and
funni
,
but
it
's
also
perfect
famili

and
relentlessli

i
have

such
a

and
thei
do

so
thei
return

the
most
obviou
element
of
a
bug
's
life
is
the
qualiti
of
anim
.
creat
by
pixar
,
the
same
peopl
who
brought
us
toi
stori
,
a
bug
's
life
ha
some
of
the
most
amaz
visual
i
've
ever
seen
.
the
bug
seem
to
inhabit
a
three-dimension
space
,
and
occasion
there
will
be
a
shot
that
is
indistinguish
from
live
action
.
thi
is
a
lush
,
color
world
,
full
of
life
and
imagin
:
the
wai
the
anim
insert
the
thing
all
of
us
see
in
our
daili
live
(
match
,
bottlecap
,
tin
can
,
etc
.
)
and
make
them
activ
object
in
the
bug
'
world
is
innov
.
the
film
is
also
mercilessli
excit
,
particularli
in
a
superbl-stage
scene
involv
our
hero
'
escap
from
a
bird
(
a
littl
bird
never
seem
so
huge
and
threaten
)
.
but
the
maker
of
a
bug
's
life
know
where
the
import
li
:
stori
and
charact
.
flick
,
with
solid
voic
work
from
folei
,
is
a
great
gui
to
lead
the
stori
.
but
the
real
treat
come
with
the
circu
bug
;
thei
're
such
a
likabl
group
of
charact
--
the
standout
ar
the
stick
(
hyde-pierc
is
so
good
)
,
franci
the
ladybug
,
and
the
big
fat
caterpillar
.
all
of
these
bug
have
more
than
a
token
person
,
which
make
the
suspens
scene
work
becaus
we
care
about
the
bug
,
and
it
also
keep
the
tear-jerk
scene
from
seem
obligatori
.
in
my
review
of
antz
,
i
said
that
the
film
is
a
clever
cop-out
becaus
it
present
a
bunch
of
littl
human
react
to
an
ant-like
exist
.
in
concept
,
a
bug
's
life
is
basic
the
same
movi
,
except
that
i
wa
never
given
enough
time
to
find
thing
that
i
did
n't
like
about
it
.
with
such
strong
work
in
both
anim
and
script
,
a
bug
's
life
is
noth
but
a
joi
to
sit
through
.
it
realli
is
too
bad
that
it
had
to
come
out
so
close
to
that
other
bug
movi
,
but
a
bug
's
life
is
so
good
that
i
'm
sure
it
will
find
it
audienc
.
after
a
slew
of
endlessli
violent
and
cynic
movi
,
it
's
downright
refresh
to
sit
through
an
innoc
pictur
like
thi
and
laugh
without
feel
guilti
.
eight

the

that

the

if

it

the
main
theme
to
emerg
from
``

is
the
fact
that
good
can
come
from
ani
situat

sonni
's
act
of
violenc
toward
anoth
human
be
is
inargu
a
horrif
thing
,
and
duval
never
shrink
from
that
fact

howev
,
that
veri

what
bring

he
goe

know
that
he
deserv
the

and
,
as
a
scene
dure
the
final
credit
show
,
he
even
turn
hi
punish
into
a
posit
opportun
for
chang
and
better
.
it
is
that
strength
in
sonni
's
charact
that
make
him
so
appeal
and
magnet
to

-
he
is

he

watch

it
's
not

to
imagin
that
he
would
have
been
a
magnific
preacher
if
he
had
chosen
that
vocat
over
act

as
sonni

he
complet
inhabit
the

and
hi
perform
is
certainli
the
best
of

duval
wa

duval
knew
that
the
power

the

enhanc

the

i
want
to
correct
what
i
wrote
last
year
in
my
retrospect
of
david
lean
's
war
pictur
.
i
still
think
that
``
the
bridg
on
the
river
kwai
``
doe
n't
deserv
be
the
number
13
in
the
american
film
institut
's
list
of
the
100
greatest
american
movi
.
and
i
think
that
``
12
angri
men
``
,
``
wit
for
the
prosecut
``
and
``
path
of
glori
``
would
have
been
better
choic
for
the
oscar
for
the
best
pictur
of
1957
.
but
i
ca
n't
deni
the
import
of
``
the
bridg
on
the
river
kwai
``
-
cinemat
and
in
it
content
.
the
film
is
set
in
burma
in
1943
.
a
batallion
of
british
soldier
in
japanes
war
captiv
is
forc
by
the
japanes
to
build
a
strateg
moment
railwai

but
the
british

(

in
thi
respect
.
afterward
col
.
nicholson
assidu
commit
himself
for
the
build
of
the
bridg
.
he
consid
it
an
opportun
to
rais
hi
men
's
moral
,
and
he
want
to
prove
superior
british
capabl
to
the
japanes
.
but
the
british
high
command
send
a
few
soldier
who
shall
destroi
the
bridg

among
them
the
american
shear
(
william

-
an
escape
from
the
japanes
prison
camp
-
and
the
british
major
warden
(
jack

.
.
.
a
flaw
of
the
pictur
is
the
clich
?
d
character
of
the
japanes
peopl
.
thei
ar
present
as
if
thei
were
intellectu
inferior
to
the
british
-
as
if
the
japanes
were
incap
of
build

bridg

and
the

doe
n't
consist
question
the
militari
spirit
as
kubrick
doe
in
``
path

``
.
lean
seem
rather
fascin
by
the
militari
hierarchi
.
thi
is
also
percept
in
the
convers
between
col

nicholson
and
col
.
saito
.
in
thi
regard
it
is
symptomat
that
shear
,
who
doubt
the
militari
logic
,
is
present
as
a
somehow
unpleas

the
audienc

nicholson
's
persever
concern
the
question
if

or
not

the
spectat
ar
suppos
to
neglect
the
risk
col
.
nicholson
take
for
hi
men
.
(
the
plot
by-pass
these

)
that
mean
,
the
pictur
is

it
ha
a

by
the
idea
of
be

and
that

(
like

get
cynic

and
lean

is
an

of

these
point
and
the
sometim

make
thi

an
anti-war

(

the

the

j

hogan
,
whose
first
featur
,
muriel
's

,
had
quit
an
offbeat
tone
for
a
tradit

stori
,
and
the
same
hold
true
for
my
best

,
which
confid
combin
tradit
romant-comedi
element
with
a
realli
eccentr
sens

the
film
is
innund
with
sly

which
seem
clearli
the
influenc
of
mr

hogan
.
for
exampl
,
there
's
a
heartfelt
,
emot
exchang
between
juliann
and
michael
late
in
the
film
-
with
a
trio
of
teenag
,
inhal
helium
and
sound
everi
bit
like
alvin
and
the
chipmunk
,
harmon
in

my

open
with
an
inspir
open
credit
sequenc
which
set
the
tone
for
the
film
,
and
there
ar
scene
where
actor
spontan
burst
into
song
to
good
comic
effect
-
it
could
almost
be
argu
that
thi
film
is
nearli
as
much
of
a
music
as
woodi
allen
's
everyon
sai
i
love
you
;
i
'd
even
assert
it
's
a
more
success
on
.
my
best
friend
's
wed
keep
break
convention
with
it
charact
as
well
.
in
a
typic
romant-comedi
,
kimmi
would
be
portrai
as
a
snooti
,
conniv
ic
queen
,
and
the
audienc
would
be
cheer
for
juliann
to
rescu
michael
from
her
grasp
;
thi
film
is
smarter
than
that
-
here
,
kimmi
is
sweet
,
sincer
,
and
innoc
;
juliann
even
admit
at
on
point
that
had
she
not
resolv
to
utterli
destroi
kimmi
's
life
,
she
'd
actual
like
her
too
.
the
georg
charact
is
almost
a
stapl
of
recent
film
-
the
homosexu
male
friend
of
the
heroin
who
act
as
a
confid
and
provid
the
guid
voic
of
reason
-
but
in
my
best
friend

wed
,
he
get
to
have
a
play
,
mischiev
and
charm
person
.
throughout
the
film
,
the
formula
on
often
see
is
romant-comedi
ar
given
littl
twist
,
and
the
result
is
a
film
which
is
compel
all
the
wai
to
it
somewhat
unorthodox
conclus
.
there
is
a
lot
of
smart
write
in
the
well-pace

ronald
bass
;
we
're
given
four
interest
,
vivid

with
some
good

a
strong

rebound
for

who
turn

it
's
not
my

to
recap
thi
centuri
everi

i
talk
about
a
new
film
,
but
i
'd
like
to
think
that
i
'm
begin
to
understand
the
art
more
as
i
watch
more
film
from
befor
my

recent
,
i
've
seen
the
film
of
hitchcock
,
capra
,
fellini

godard
,
kurosawa
,
chaplin
,
lang
,
and
mani

?
those

thei
ar

thi

too

ye
,
it
's
a

?
true
,
it
budget
is
a

more
monei
than
i
'll
ever
see
in

?
and
there
's
not
a
doubt
in
my

that
the
onli

it

conceiv
wa
to
make
a

in

i
bet
the

of
armageddon
would
have
work
toward
a
lousi

had
thei
thought
it
would
've
been
more

.
i
certainli
do
n't

what
their

were
,
becaus
michael
bai
(

is
such
a
skill

i

he
'd
ever

a

actual
ha
charact
you

care
about
!
if
you
do
n't
like
thi
film
,
then
you
have
a
problem
with
the
genr
itself
:
armageddon
is
as
good
as
a
film
like
thi
can
be
.
if
you
've
seen
deep
impact
,
then
you
know
the
basic
framework
for
the
stori
.
it
turn
out
that
an
asteroid
the
size
of
texa
is
go
to
strike
the
earth
eighteen
dai
from
the
start
of

so
,
it
's
up

to
stop
it

(

a

or
whatev
it
is
you
'd

it
's
not
about

it
's
about
viscera
and
action
,
and
thrill-a-minut
,
and
all
that
stuff
.
it
's
incident
,
realli
,
that
the
stori
is
cohes
and
even
remot
believ
,
becaus
most
peopl
will
be
too
wrap
up
in
the
explos
to
give
two
second
'
thought
to
what
actual
happen
.
but
bai
is
the
on
to
congratul
in
thi
case
,
for
he
ha
made
a
film
so
entertain
and
so
visual
sharp
that
i
doubt
ani
director
could
have
done
it
better
.
i
think
most
of
the
budget
went
to
camera
alon
,
becaus
bai
film
everi

sequenc
from
about

car
spin
like
top
upon

the
action
itself
might
take
five
second
in
real
life
,
but
bai
edit
so
quickli
that
we
get
the
same
scene
in

i
like

i
do

ever
feel

about

;
he
add
depth

here
she
tend
to
overact
when

le

,
as
i

a

intellig

my
onli
complaint
is
that
it
feel
a
bit
too
easi
,
and
perhap
too
stage
.
each
scene
is
grand
and
huge
,
and
explod
with
poledouri
'
score
,
but
i
did
n't
alwai
want
them
to
be
.
for
the
most
part
,
le
miser
is
not
a
subtl
or
deep
pictur
.
it
's
a
good
movi
,
and
tell
it
stori
well
,
but
august
tend
to
hand-feed
us
theme
and
scene
that
would
have
work
better
had
thei
been
more
subtl

howev
,
in

a

in

thi

screenwrit
john
august
and
director
doug
liman
assembl
a
cast
of
charact
that
would
n't
usual
be
the
type
to
have
an
entir
film
revolv
around
them
,
such
as
a
teenag
supermarket
cashier
,
a
bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain
dealer
and
two
struggl
soap
opera
actor
.
these
type
of
charact
might
not
sound
all
that
origin
,
but
consid
that
thei
will
all
be
somehow
effect
by
a
strip
club
bouncer
and
hi
psychot

,
a
mid-level

a

,
a

,
two
shrimp-scarfer
and
a

to

how
thei
will
all
come
togeth
is
the
process
the
film
deal
with
.
i
'd
imagin
the
concept
to
the

out

test
themselv
to
see
if
thei
could

pull
it
off
and
the
outcom
is
a
terrif
achiev
in

and
the
craft

in
gener
.
the
film
start
out
as
anyth
els
,
with
littl
indic
of
what
's
to
come
.
we
meet
ronna
(
pollei
)
,
a
depress

checkout
girl
who
doe
n't
seem
to
have
much
desir
to

anyth
except

just
to

her

.
she
's
not

charm
,
especi
to
her
custom
,
but
thi
is
plai
mostli
for
laugh
rather
than
character
and
it
work
.
mayb
thi
is
becaus
she
's
not
a
veri
afeminit
charact
,
but
she
's
far
from
masculin
-
a

inde
.
thing
start
to
progress
when
ronna
reluctantli
agre
to
take
the
hour
of
the
goofi
,
hyperact
,
yet
likabl
simon
(
askew
)
,
an
english
teen
into
vice
for
the
sake
of
the
experi
.
thi
agreement
start
a
three-prong
storylin
as
it
allow
simon
to
go
to
la
vega
for
the
weekend
with
hi
friend
and
in
turn
drag
ronna
and
her
friend
into
bui
and
sell
an
experiment
drug
.
the
process
of
which
will
not
onli
bring
ronna
close
to
be
arrest
but
also
to
death
.
nearli
the
same
can
be
said
for
two
other
charact
,
zack
(
mohr
)
and
adam
(
wolf
)
,
who
we
do
n't
think
much
of
when
thei
first
appear
as
support
charact
,
but
later
will
becom
major
player
to
the
film
's
makeup
-
anoth
process
us
by
the
filmmak
to
elabor
on
the
theori
of
how
signific
insignific
interact
might
be
.
onc
the
pace
is
pick
up
the
film
realli
begin
to
show
it
mettl
.
when
the
titl
screen
`ronna
'
is
flash
shortli
after
the
aforement
turn
point
scene
,
it
's
clear
thi
film
is
n't
go
to
emploi
the
standard
linear
method
of
storytel
.
consid
how
good
it
is
up
until
that
point
,
it
's
a
long
overdu
chang
of
pace
need
in
movi
todai
.
and
so
the
film
begin
to
take
shape
,
first
by
follow
ronna
and
her
friend
on
a
on-night
adventur
that
begin
with
a
drug
deal
instig
by
zack
and
adam
(
who
were
actual
look
for
simon
)
,
which
doe
n't
exactli
go
as
plan
,
but
that
's
what
keep
it
all
so
interest
.
the
second
storylin
start
at
the
same
moment
as
ronna
's
stori
,
but
thi
time
the
camera
choos
to
follow
simon
instead
.
simon
and
hi
three
friend
head
to
?
vega
for
a
night
on
the
town
and
in
the
process
experi
thing
thei
never
would
have
imagin
.
the
third
arc
,
about
zack
and
adam
,
again
overlap
with
ronna
's
stori
tell
much
of
the
same
stori
but
from
a
complet
differ
angl
.
we
're
shown
thing
we
never
would
have
expect
were
go
on
while
follow
ronna
.
and
mani
of
the
event
that
do
happen
to
ronna
becaus
of
zack
and
adam
ar
n't
even
their
fault
-
thei
just
happen
to
be
where
thei
were
when
thei
were
.
i
'd
realli
like
to
dissect
each
of
the
three
storylin
and
especi
how
the
film
wrap
up
in
the
end
,
but
that
would
take
up
too
much
time
and
space
and
spoil
everyth
for
those
who
have
n't
seen
the
film
.
perhap
the
greatest
element
to
the
film
is
it
constant
surpris
and
unpredict
,
and
not
due
to
plot
twist
or
a

just

thi

for

tarantino
is
attempt

robert

ar
solid

bridget

is
around

:
to
look
sexi
in

,
to
provid
a
littl
twist
comedi
,
and
to
satisfi
tarantino
's
foot

.
robert
de
niro
is
crimin
underus
in
a
part
that
could
have
been
plai
equal
well
by
ani
grungi-
look
,
middl-ag
actor
.
the
film
,
which
clock
in
at
sever
minut
over
the
two-and-a-
half
hour
mark
,
is
probabl
too
long
for
the
materi
,
but
the
plot
is
convolut
enough
to
keep
us
guess
throughout
(
although
the
payoff
is
a
letdown
)
.
tarantino
keep
thing
move
along
nice
,
with
a
heavier
dose
of
humor
and
less
violenc
than
in
pulp
fiction
,
but
,
on
the
whole
,
thi
movi
seem
more
like
the
work
of
on
of
hi
wannab
than
someth
from
the
director
himself
.
when
it
come
to
recent
caper
film
(
like
the
grifter
and
bound
)
,
jacki
brown
is
a
second-tier
effort
.
it
's
an
entertain
divers
,
but
not
a
masterpiec
,
and
certainli
not
an
oscar

.
on
of
the
biggest
clich

ani

film
is
also
on
of
the
most
believ

it

on

about

how

as

mani
peopl
will
compar
thi
film
to
1995
's
seven
,
anoth
killer
film
star
morgan
freeman
,
but
i
presum
that
the
similar
ar
intent
.
the
screenplai
,
by
david
klass
,
is
adapt
from
the
novel
written
by
jame
patterson
,
and
yet
i
do
n't
quit
see
how
thi
stori
could
have
work
in
novel
form
.
what
make
kiss
the
girl
so
good
is
the
act
and
the
technic
and
visual
impress
.
the
cinematographi
,
by
aaron
schneider
,
is
reminisci
of
seven
,
and
sometim
i
felt
that
mani
of
the
shot
were
try
too
hard
to
impress
us
.
sometim
a
simpl
shot
is
the
best
on
.
howev
,
mani
of
the
shot
ar
stun
,
and
unlik
seven
,
most
of
them
take
place
dure
the
dai
,
in
sunlight
.
the
scene
when
ashlei
judd
is
run
through
the
forest
is
extrem
well
done
,
in
more
than
on
wai
.
the
camera
work
is
terrif
,
but
the
edit
make
thi
scene
work
so
well
.
the
chaotic
and
mtv-type
cut
give
the
audienc
a
sens
of
confus
and
unawar
,
exactli
what
judd
's
charact
is
experienc
.
howev
,
the
best
aspect
of
kiss
the
girl
is
it
actor
.
morgan
freeman
is
on
of
todai
's
most
power
and
believ
actor
.
detect
cross
is
a
veri
good
charact
for
him
,
although
it
is
just
a
similar
on
to
the
charact
in
seven
.
becaus
of
freeman
's
power
presenc
,
he
carri
half
the
film
by
himself
.
the
other
half
is
carri
by
ashlei
judd
,
on
of
todai
's
most
promis
dramat
actress
.
in
fact
,
her
perform
is
better
than
freeman
's
,
if
that
is
even
possibl
.
her
charact
is
more
origin
than
freeman
's
,
and
she
handl
it
wonderfulli
.
we
final
have
a
femal
charact
in
a
movi
like
thi
who
doe
more
than
just
scream
.
the

on

i
had
with

wa
the
motiv

.
i
blame
thi
mainli
on
the
cast
director
,
becaus
the
killer
's
motiv
is
becaus
of
reject
from
women
(
or
so
i
assum
from
the
open
monologu
)
,
but
the
killer
himself
is
veri

(
on
of
my
friend
is
a
,
shall
we
sai
,
big
admir
of

)
.
kiss
the

is
rate
r
for
terror
,
violenc
,
languag
,
and
suggest

.
with
all
the
implaus
of
thi
film
,
and
with
the
mediocr
second
half
,
kiss
the
girl
somehow
manag
to
thoroughli
entertain
.
in
fact
,
i
had
the
urg
to
see
it
again
just
for
the
perform
.
the
cinematographi
add
a
lot
of
mood
to
the
alreadi
creepi
tone
,
and
the
script
is
usual
smart
.
thi
is
clearli
on
of
those
movi
which
reli
on
the
act
to
pull
it
through
.
morgan
freeman
is
possibl
todai
's
most
convinc
actor
,
and
ashlei
judd
add
anoth
notch
on
her
act
belt
.
i
must
also
sai
that
i
love
the
end
.
the
showdown
between
good
and
evil
wa
quit
tens
,
and
the
resolut
of
the
scene
make
almost
anyon
cheer
.
perhap
it
mai
not
be
possibl
,
but
most
of
the
film
is
n't
anywai
.
i
wa
origin
go
to
give
the
spanish
prison
two
and
half
star
.
from
my
first
view
,
i
notic
that
david
mamet
's

wa
intens
and
clever
at
time
but
bore
and
clich

to

thi
probabl
is
a
result
of
the

be
from
a
stage
plai
.
the
plai
wa
in
turn
is
base
on
a
time
in
the
life
of
the
playwright
.
what
seem
to
be
an
underli

ar
the
pagan

,
both
in

in
the
quiet
after
the

we
muse
that
it
's
sad
that
music
ha
to
ceas

and

falter
.
the
movi
is
frame
by
a
scene
of
michael

,
the
narrat
of

,
as
a

fly

he

the
mundi
famili
itself
follow
a
similar
fate
to
that
of
the

,
and
kate

hold
of

enough
to

as

the

that

,
and
is
sucker
into
bui
her

the

it
realli
make
you
wonder
,
how
screenwrit
realli
get
their
idea
,
could
it
simpli
be
from
a
friend
or
a
bum
in
the
street
?
the
idea
itself
is
provok
and
brook
doe
it
in
a
hilari
manner
.
speak
of
brook
,
he
wa
absolut
hyster
as
a
screenwrit
.
everi
time
he
grace
the
screen
,
i
ca
n't
help
but
start
laugh
.
albert
ha
a
veri
uniqu
sens
of
humor
that
make
him
a
veri
likeabl
charact
.
the
real
problem
with
the
film
li
with
sharon
stone
.
she
wa
n't
likeabl
at
all
.
brook
had
the
right
idea
with
her
occup
,
but
she
never
pull
through
.
in
a
wai
,
she
drain
energi
from
the
onc
funni
atmospher
and
left
it
bleak
.
luckili
brook
could
clean
up
the
mess
,
and
cover
for
stone
's
mishap
.
it
wa
a
shame
that
the
film
went
slightli
downhil
after
her
appear
,
becaus
``
the
muse
``
had
the
potenti
to
a
be
a
veri
authent
comedi
.
on
a
brighter
note
,
andi
macdowel
wa
also
charm
as
brook
's
wife
.
she
is
alwai
a
nice
addit
as
a
support
actress
,
becaus
she
ha
that
charisma
that
seem
to
complet
the
atmospher
to
ani
film
she
's
in
.
the
funniest
moment
in
``
the
muse
``
in
my
opinion
were
the
cameo
by
jame
cameron
and
martin
scorses
.
i
mean
imagin
,
brook
see
these
big

,
like
it
wa
someth
out
of
the
ordinari
.
it
wa
just
plain
hilari
.
it
just
add
to
the
satir
joke
,
of
how
director
get
idea
.
brilliant
move
by
brook
.
as
i
mention
befor
,
the
film
is
a
satir
much
like
it
's
proceed
bowfing
,
which
came
out
a
few

befor
.
unlik
bowfing
,
thi
is
not
a
mean
spirit
film
that
's
desper
for
joke
,
it
's
rather
a
witti
and
humor
look
at
hollywood
.
``
bowfing
``
had
it
's
moment
,
but
had
quit
a
few
problem
that
were
never
work
out
,
but
``
the

still
manag
to

despit

by

you

much
of
the
stori
is
told
simpli
through
the
interact

lefti

pacino

we
learn
of

which

when

it
's
easi
to
sympath

newel
constantli

thi
aspect

make
it
a
major
theme
which
work
well
in
the
long
run
.
as
donni
is
constantli
impress
and
even
on-up
lefti
,
it
's
hard
to
tell
which
emot
is
more
power
:
the
fact
donni
is
get
closer
to
nail
the
mob
;
or
the
fact
lefti
ha
onc
again
been
over
shadow
.
most
of
the
film
tell
the
stori
of
donni
's
life
in
mafia
,
which
creat
for
mani
sub-plot
and
individu
conflict
,
but
doe
n't

seem
to
come
togeth
as
a
whole
.
the
storytel
is
genuin

throughout
,
even
when
the
motion
the
charact
go
through
seem
familiar

the

he
often
report
back
to
the
fed
with

it

in

would
have

as
it
is
just

out
,
three

is
a
comedi
in

the

clever
scene
that
is

on
the
outcom
of
most
romant-mistaken
ident

.
three

is
a
gem

:
three

of
the
better
romant
comedi
of

.
the
question
is
n't
why
ha
greas
been
reissu
.
the
answer
to
that
on
is
easi
:
to
celebr
the
movi
's
20th
anniversari
and
to
make
more
buck
for
paramount
's
coffer
becaus
john
travolta
is
onc
again
a
hot
commod
.
no
,
the
question
that
ought
to
be
ask
is
:
should
greas
be
reissu
?
the
answer
is
not
an
easi
on
.
greas
is
a
fun
movi
,
an
entertain
fantasi
of
the
'50s
,
embodi
all
the
clich
of
that
era
.
the
music
is
live
and
the
danc
number
,
choreograph
by
patricia
birch
,
ar
energet
and
high-spirit
.
travolta
wa
at
hi
pinnacl
as
a
sexual
icon
,
cool
,
but
non-threaten
.
but
greas
did
n't
break
ani
new
cinemat
ground
.
it
wa
not
a
mileston
in
movi
histori
such
as
citizen
kane
or
easi
rider
.
what
greas
is
-
or
ha
becom
-
is
the
highest-gross
music
in
film
histori
.
ok
,
let
's
not
be
a
spoilsport
.
greas
is
a
fun
and
entertain
movi
,
even
though
it
stretch
credul
to
see
such
perform
as
travolta
,
olivia
newton-john
,
taxi
's
jeff
conawai
and
the
multi-talent
stockard
chan
try
to
act
like
high
schooler
.
it
's
nostalg
to
recal
how
good
a
dancer
travolta
wa
,
and
it
's
sad
to
think
of
what
could
have
been
had
not
a
few
misstep

.
he
could

becom

two
reason
have
contribut

the
demis
of

:
the
first
is
that

audienc
have
becom
more
sophist
,
no
,
make
that
cynic
and
jade
.
todai
,
if
a
charact
began
to
danc
and
sing
with
no
orchestra
in
sight
,
he
or
she
would
probabl
be
hoot
off
the
screen
.
todai
's
audienc
lack
the
innoc
,
that
belief
in
movi
magic
that
is
requir
for
a
music
to
succe
.
secondli
,
a
lack
of

.
perform
with
the
charisma
,
the
style
,
the
larger-than-life
panach
of
fred
astair
,
gene
kelli
,
ginger

ar
gone
.
most
singer
and
dancer
remain
on
the
stage
,
and
those
who
do
succe
in
movi
usual
wind
up
in
seriou
dramat

.
a
good
exampl
is
gregori
hine
,
on
of
the
greatest

he
danc
a
bit
in

but
those

so
,
perhap
the
reissu
of
greas
can
serv
a
purpos
.
if

show
enough
interest
,
mean
if
the

it

of

you
know
how
there
ar
alwai
these
``
hanger-on
``
gangster
type
who
latch
on
to
the
godfath
,
the
leader
,
the
top
dog
of
everi
crime
organ
?
well
,
most
of
the
time
,
these
dude
ar
screen
beforehand
and
ar
loyal
to
onli
on
person
.
.
.
that
is
,
their
boss
.
so
all
the
gangster
number
on
need
to
worri
about
is
hi
enemi
on
the
other
side
of
the
fenc
.
but
thi
film
bring
the
betray
,
the
mess
up
loyalti
,
the
honor
code
among
bad
gui
into
plai
within
the

and
present
it

the

,
jazz
it
all
up
with
a
hip

or
add
ani
humor
to
the
mix
.
nope
,
he
goe
straight
for
the
seriou
stuff
and
develop
at
least
two
particular
scene
which
ar
still
embed
in
my
mind
as
i
type
thi
.
the
first
is
a
confront
sequenc
between
bettani
and
a
man
from
which
he
's
attempt
to
swai
some
inform
and
it
is
downright
nasti
!
(
``
look
into
my
ey
!
``
)
in
fact
,
the
last
time
that
i
've
seen
a
gui
so
scare
in
a
movi
wa
john
turturro
in
that
forest
scene
from
the
coen
brother
'
miller
's
cross
.
scari
shite
.
but
there
's
an
ever
better
scene
than
that
in
thi
film
.
thi
on
featur
bettani
,
onc
again
,
slowli
tortur
,
hack
and
beat
the
live
piss
out
of
a
rival
gangster
(
from
that
man
's
point-of-view
)
,
but
not
befor
turn
on
a
quaint
littl
tune
in
the
background
and
remov
all
of
hi
own
expens
cloth
,
on
by
on
(
that
's
right
,
he
``
doe
``
the
gui
in
hi
underwear
)
.
that
scene
is
also
in
tune
with
some
of
the
obviou
phallic
and
homoerot
underton
present
throughout
thi
film
,
especi
in
the
relationship
between
bettani
and
hi
boss
(
why
doe
he
get
so
upset
when
he
fall
in
love
with
that
woman
?
)
.
but
the
flick
's
not
perfect
.
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
mind
malcolm
mcdowel
's
voic-over
narrat
at
first
,
but
as
the
film
grew
into
a
major
flashback
(
most
of
the
film
is
present
as
such
)
,
he
came
in
everi
now
and
then
,
and
rare
ad
anyth
of
interest
to
the
plot
.
all
he
seem
to
do
wa
swear
and
call
peopl
the
c-word
umpteen
time
,
and
even
describ
on
scene
as
it
wa
happen
(
``
.
.
.
so
i
open
the
door
,
then
went
up
the

etc
.
.

also

the

that
it

thi

is
a

addit

note

thi

make
it
hard
to
make
out
some
of

it

also
quit
violent

all

the

the

sound
much
like

that

not

thi

with

there
ar

the

the

rather
than
the

he
ha
been

make

the

confus

why
the

ar
never

my
feel

that
thi
could
never

thi
could
never
be
a
man
who
inspir
hundr

so
why
do

there

the

there
ar

the

a

30

of

.
yet
,
you
can
not
shake
the
feel
that
there
is
so
much
more
thi
film
could
have
done
.
the
psychot

is
unforgett

inde
the

but
on
still
can
not

the
feel
that
thi
film
could
have
so
much
more
power
,
had
the
charact
of
kurtz
been
more
explor

and
had

succumb
to
the
fate
that
the

thought
he

there
is

not

it
could

thi

the
stori
unfold
at

pace
dictat
by
the
live
of

without

the
focu
of
the
stori
is
two

david

the

who
ha
grown

viggo

the

wild
behavior
seem
to
be
a
reaction
to
some
ancient

that
he
ca
n't

much
less

the

pick
the

up

when
mortensen
return

and

it
becom
clear
that
some
kind
of
conflict
threaten
the
link
that
the

the

is
unobtrus

it

it

thi

well-done

i
love
thi

so
much
,
i
'll
make
a
minor
note
that
it
certainli
is
n't
perfect
.
although
it
is
origin
and
mesmer
,
it
doe
fall
prei
to
a
few
of
the
clich
of
the
genr
.
the
plot
of
the
stori
by
writer
dawn

is
rather
formula
(
though
the
detail
ar
what
make
the
stori
excel
,

ha
done
a
great
job
with
them
)

the
end
,
too
,
could
have
been
more
power

less

these
element
ar
minor
,

,

detract
from

the

these

base
on
a
stori
by
roald

it
tell
of
young
matilda

an
extraordinarili
bright

whose
great
misfortun
it
is
to
have
a

of

parent
:
harri

,
a

and
zinnia

,
a

addict

the

bare
notic
matilda
exist
,
and
when
thei
do
,
it
is
onli
to
scold
her

too
much
time
read

.
when
thei
final
do
send
her
to

,
it
is
to

a
bleak

run
by
cruel
,
child-hate
miss
agatha

thing
begin
to

matilda

which
allow
her
to
help
herself

to
overcom

cruelti
.
it
wa
thi
spring
's
jame
and
the
giant
peach
which
inspir
me
to
note
that
the
best
and
most
last
tale
for
children
tend
to
have
more
than
a
hint
of
dark
to
them
,
and
you
can
bet
that
the
roald
dahl
respons
for
the
gleeful
ghoulish
of
jame
and
willi
wonka
and
the
chocol
factori
ha
more
of
the
same
in
store
with
matilda
.
and
just
as
jame
benefit
from
the
dark
sensibl
of
henri
selick
and
tim
burton
,
matilda
soar
on
the
cock-ei
direct
of
danni
devito
.
devito
made
black
humor

the
war

,
and
he

some
memor

in
on
scene
,
an
unfortun
girl
is
made
an
exampl
of
by
miss
trunchbul
when
she
is
pick
up
by
her
pig-tail
and
flung
through

later
,
an
overweight

matilda
is

a

that

there
is
a
hilari
moment
when
matilda

charact
by

is
the

he
's
a
dry

subtl

sterotyp
straight-face
doctor

end
up

some
of

funniest
line
of
the

in
a
film
like
thi
,
you
're
not
realli
expect
an
elabor
product
,
so
on
ca
n't
complain
about
the
amateurish
qualiti

what
you
can
complain
about
is
the
absolut
annoi
johnni

plai
by
stephen

thi
charact
is
pointless
,
nauseat
,
and
veri
unfunni

i
do
n't
know
why
he
wa
put
in
there
,
and
i
do
n't
think
anybodi
will
find
a
good
excus

and
when
the
film
near
an
end
,
it
slow
down
quit
a
bit
,
almost
get
old
.
you
got
ta
give
it

even

the

ha
onli
a
19
million

which
doesn

show
all
the
wai
through
but
you
can
tell
.
the
movi
wa
written
well
,
and
it
's
onli
major
flaw
is
the
under-develop
charact
and
plot
hole
that
we
ar
left
with
.
the

is
quit
clever
and
some
mai
not

i
found
a
good
halloween

hous

on
of
those
movi
you

though
it
is
a
well-made
movi
with
a
good
storylin
it
still
ha
some
flaw
.
but
besid
that
the
movi
is
fun

why

here
,
the

have
manag
to

the

the
kei
to

that

let
me
open
thi
on
with
a
confess
:
i
love
cop
movi
.
i
ador
them
with
such
an
unwav
,
near
foolish
passion
that
i
wa
actual
on
of
the
first
in
line
to
see
1998
's
on
tough
cop
star
the
smirkiest
of
the
baldwin
brother
,
steven
.
wa
it
ani
good
?
well
,
just
about
as
good
as
baldwin
's
steven
seagal
impress
(
for
those
i
've
confus
the
answer
is
a
resound
no
!
)
.
now
let
me
clarifi
,
i
do
n't
love
just
ani
cop
movi
;
i
'm
not
too
keen
on
the
smug
buddi
cop
flick
that
were
so
in
vogu
in
the
80
's
and
now
slowli
(
gulp
)
return
thank
to
jacki
chan
and
chri
tucker
.
i
'm
partial
to
those
gritti
,
earthi
cop
drama
like
serpico
,
donni
brasco
,
and
the
french
connect
.
problem
is
these

come

just
about
as

as

bush
make

whenev
a

i

?
?
and
inevit
i
leav
,
head
bow
,
trip
over
my

so
what
is
it
about

that
transform
me
into
a
moron
will
to
shell
out
$

the

tap
into

turn
it
all
into

as

i
still

now
what

an

of
a

due

it

when

as

come
off
as
a
sad
,
but
dignifi
man
,
and
a
person
who
wa
not
afraid
to
stand
out
from

,
just
as
long
as
he
knew
he
wa
be
true

he
never

the
fact
that
he
wa
gai

howev

even
if
it

it

of

someon
he
can

,
while
it
mean
so
much
more
to
whale
,
who
see
boon
as
sort
of

salvat
in

.
although
boon
is
onli
in
a
dead-end

as
a
garden
of

,
whale
view
him
as

sinc

disapprov

,
it
is

that

can
talk

extrem
fine
and
matur
pictur

a
few
small
element
hold
the
film
back

it
is
appreci
that
the

doe
not
pull
for
ani
obviou
or
overli

but
it
is
a
littl
thin
,
and
the
structur
of
the
``
on-again-off-again
``
friendship
at
the
film
's
center
is
fairli
predict
.
we
know
earli
on
where
these
two
charact
ar
head
,
and
we
can
guess
that
there
will
be
a
final
confront
between
the
two
as
the
tension
slowli
build
.
in
lesser
hand
,
thi
set-up
might
have
felt
too
calcul
,
but
it
is
not
in
the
surprisingli
deft
treatment
and
write
that
help
the
film
to
be
much
more
than
thi
.
also
,
a

briefli
brought
up
between
clayton

at
a
bar
(

,
but
abruptli
drop
and
never
brought
up
again
.
if
the

wa
not
go

then
it
,
perhap
,
should
have

for

look
at

in
the
movi
it
seem
as
if
thei
ar
n't
act
but
ar
actual
the
charact
in

movi
.
the
cast
for
the
movi
could
realli
have
been
better
,
in
my
humbl
opinion
that
is
.
on
charact
that
will
most
like
not
be
mention
by
ani
other
review

commentari
about
thi

is
that
of

.
ye
,
you
read
correctli
,
the
ship
is
a
charact
.
how
is
the
titan
a
charact
?
you
ask
well
simpl
,
a
ship
had
a
certain
charact
about
it
and
as
most
sailor
and
boat
men
will
tell
you
.
thi
charact
is
everyth
about
the
ship
from
it
specif
to
it
luxuri
and
the
titan
wa
no
stranger
to
thi
.
mr
.
cameron
bring
the
ship
to
life
in
an
almost
liter
sens
.
all
thi
add
to
the
movi
in
a
certain
wai
that
most
hollywood
product
cant
seem
to
grasp
.
now
,
to
produc
the
effect
that
i
mention
abov
and
to
sink
the
ship
itself
ar
feat
that
ar
accomplish
by
special
effect
wizard
.
the
effect
in
thi
movi
rang
from
marvel
costum
to
beautifulli
render
scene
of
the
ship
sink
.
in
some
respect
you
can
not
tell
that
the
effect
ar
there
,
you
simpli
think
that
what
you
see
is
what
happen
or
what
is
happen
(
if
your
imagin
is
good
)
.
the
technic
wizardri
done
in
thi
movi
is
just
spectacular
and
actual
get
new
footag
from
the
wreck
of
the
titan
is
uniqu
.
the
movi
will
leav
you
amaz
at
the
effect
,
and
that
is
a
feat
sinc
there
is
no
monster
or
alien
in
thi
movi
,
just
human
and
an
overs
ship
.
the
movi
will
amaz
you
and
it
will
pull
on
your
emot
,
the
theater
that
i
went
to
had
a
few
peopl
leav
with
tear
in
their
ey
.
now
that
is
not
a
feat
accomplish
by
most
movi
,
now
the
fact
that
the
tragedi
actual
occur
is
brought
home
with
someth
of
a
punch
,
i
wont
spoil
the
end
and
sai
what
happen
regardless
it
is
an
interest
movi
from
begin
to
the
veri
end
.
the
histor
valu
of
thi
movi
is
quit
high
,
and
honestli
is
someth
that
should
be
watch
for
the
sake
of
see
it
and
see
the
tragedi
,
for
it
is
extrem
well
done
.
the
method
of
tell
the
stori
is
also
good
,
mayb
not
total
uniqu
but
effect
none
the
less
.
regardless
of
anyth
mention
abov
thi
movi
is
a
grandios
product
and
the
sheer
size
of
the
project
undertaken
is
someth
to
be
marvel
at
.
the
simpl
fact
that
the
movi
is
smashingli
success
at
what
it
aim
to
achiev
is
just
astonish
.
if
you
get
the
chanc
to
see
thi
movi
go
!
!
!
it
might
not
be
the
best
movi
in
the
world
.
.
but
it
rank
fairli
highli
and
is
well
worth
the
time
spent
watch
it
.
dure
none
of
the
3
hour
and
13
minut
of
the
movi
ar
you
bore
nor
doe
your
attent
wane

the
start
of
thi

remind
me
of

,
the
movi
jump
into

the

improv

the
basic
idea
behind
the
movi
is
that

the

the

thi

it

as
it
introduc
us
to
it
charact
,
all
of
them
resid
in
a
southern
town
call
holli
spring
.
first
we
meet
willi
(
charl
s
.
dutton
)
,
an
honest
man
with
a
slight
drink
habit
.
we
then
see
that
willi
take
care
of
an
elderli
ladi
nicknam
cooki
,
who
is
slowli
lose
her
grip
on
saniti
and
is
be
fill
with
loneli
,
despair
,
and
want
of
her
dead
husband
.
we
cut
to
camil
(
glenn
close
)
who
is
obsess
direct
a
plai
with
her
sister
cora
(
juliann

)
.
then
we
briefli
get
acquaint
with
emma
(
liv
tyler
)
,
an
appar
rel
of
cooki
,
who
is
a
down-but-not-out
teen
outcast
,
still
full
of
love
and
hope
even
though
she
ha
no
real
place
to
live
.
we
also
fleetingli
see
emma
's
lover
jason
(
chri

,
an
ambiti

far
too
excit
young
cop
.
we
ar
now
about
on
quarter
through
the
two

pictur
,
and
robert
altman
decid
that
it
is
time
to
set
the
plot
in
motion
.
we
see
the
ecstat
cooki
stare
hopefulli
at
a
pictur
of
her
husband
.
she
exclaim
``
here
i
come
!
``
and
then
put
a
pillow
to
her
face
and
shoot
herself
.
soon
after
,
her
niec
camil
stop
by
to
get
a
fruit
salad
bowl
,
come
upstair
,
find
cooki
dead
and
flip
out
.
convinc
that
suicid
is
a
disgrac
and
that
she
will
have
none
of
that
in
her
famili
,
she
eat
the
suicid
note
and
convinc
her
slightli
slow
(
yet
sweet
)
sister
that
it
wa
a
murder
.
she
make
sure
that
she
stage
it
like
a
murder
as
well
;
scatter
jewelri
all
over
the
floor
,
break
a
few
cabinet
,
window
and
door
,
and
then
throw
the
gun
out
in
the
back
yard
.
the
onli
reason
suspect
is
willi
,
who
immedi
get
taken
into
custodi
,
and
put
in
a
jail
cell
(

what
is
behind
the
complex
plot
in
exotica
?
first
,
a
common
theme
of
the
quest
for
gratif
by
monetari
mean
.
the
lone
tax-auditor
,
the
repress
homosexu
pet
shop
owner
,
the
pregnant

which
run

all

to
bui

relief
for
the
penuri
of
the
soul
.
.
.
.
then
we
have
the
quest
for
gratif
through
visual
mean
by
most
of
the
same
peopl
,
includ
those
who
sit
watch
exotica
.
.
.
.
in
that
regard
exotica
stand
for

,
for
the

through

mirror
,
and
poor-rich
peopl
look
at
other
's
peopl
live
through
a
silver

.
exotica
also
stand
for
unwant
societi
attent
into
the
live
of
other
peopl
,
such
as
the
tax
auditor
and
the
pet

owner
.
exotica
is
the
custom
agent
look
at
the
pet
shop
owner
,
which
in
turn
is
look
at
the
core
of
the
problem
between
the
strip
dancer
and
the
tax
auditor
through
the
detach

of
a

)
,
and
onli
interest
on
avoid
jail
(
no

with
the

)
.
in
exotica
everybodi

and
what

second
,
exotica
is
about

about

i
actual
am
a
fan
of
the
origin
1961
or
so
live-action-disnei

of
the

everyon

i

of

(
my

:
unless

the

or
do
someth
differ
with

or
mayb
even
both

just
wrack
your
brain
and
come
up
with
a

gasp

)
.
thi
remak

of

and
wa
actual
quit
the

the

thi
on

howev

is

in

,
it
's
actual
good

not
the
origin
good
,

what
's
great
about
it
is
that
it
doe
n't
necessarili
retread
the
origin

captur
the

exact
spirit
as
it
doe
becom
entertain
for
the

exact

wa
entertain

becaus
it
's
cute
and
innoc
fun
.
becaus
it
ha
a
pretti
killer
plot
that
is
endlessli
fun
to
follow
along
with
.
becaus
the
lead

is

becaus

and
(

becaus
it

there
's
noth

risqu

save
the
plot
(
the
idea

them

omin
selfish

that
is

it
's
more
of
a
late

movi

becaus
it
deal
with
the
issu

it
deal
with
it
in
a
disnei-iz

it
's
play
,

witti

charm

and
if
i
saw
it
for

,
have
never

part

i
'd

i
'd
probabl
do
the

for

if
i

i

rememb
what
fun
it

about

out

manipul

a

at

for

thi

did
that
for

it
's
also
charm

it
ha
a

a

,
for

a

in

why

especi
the

he
's

but
the
bigger
surpris
for
me
in
thi
film
wa
helen
hunt
,
an
actress
who
i
wa
openli
``
sick

``
in

late

(

you

she
's

look
to

,
and
doe
n't
miss
a
beat

i
did
n't
care
much
for
her
run
joke
about
him
``

whenev
he
left
a

,
but
overal
she
wa
realli
good
and
i
especi
like
the
wai
that
her
sweater
clung
to
her
breast
as
thei
did
.
.
.
yum
,
yum
!
harumph
,
but
i
digress
.
so
let
's
recap
.
a
great
look
pictur
with
a
nice
jazzi
score
,
some
funni
on-liner
,
especi
in
the
second
half
,
a
decent
plotlin
,
although
you
should
n't
expect
a
real
mysteri
or
anyth
,
and
some
solid
act
all
around
.
i
ca
n't
sai
that
thi
is
even
remot
close
to
ani
of
allen
's
best
work
,
but
i
certainli
believ
it
to
be
a
step
in
the
right
direct
,
especi
after
the
dinki
decad
of
film
that
he
just
went
through
.
it
's
probabl
better
gear
toward
allen
fan
more
than
anyon
els
,
but
i
would
still
recommend
thi
film
to
anyon
look
for
a
cute

of

)
.
and
then
you
settl
in
for
a
nice
resolut
,
which
doe
not
occur
.
it
wa
at
thi
point
that
i
felt
cheat
.
take
us
on
a
terror
ride
of
intrigu
,
we
follow
kevin
lomax
around
,
as
he
is
the
centerpiec
of
the
film
.
everyth
occur
from
hi
perspect
.
he
is
our
represent
on
screen
(
sort
of
)
.
but
we
ar
forc
to
wit
a
conclus
which
make
most
of
the
film
seem
like
a
game
.
i
do
n't
want
to
spoil
the
end
,
so
all
i
can
sai
is
go
see
the
film
and
decid
for
yourself
.
perhap
the
most
shock
thing
about
the
devil
's
advoc
is
the
extrem
amount
of
everyth
.
it
earn
it
r
rate
for
a
reason
.
there
is
plenti
of
nuditi
,
sex
,
violenc
,
gore
,
and
then
you
have
gore
,
violenc
,
sex
,
and
more
nuditi
.
thi
film
realli
is
n't
subtl
about
anyth
,
show
us
everyth
.
it
actual
surpris
me
that
thi
film
did
not
receiv
an
nc-17
rate
,
as
it
is
quit
harsh
.
howev
,
the
movi
doe
have
it
merit
,
and
nuditi
and
sex
ar
among
those
.
i
do
n't
condon
sex
and
nuditi
in
film
,
but
if
it
there
,
i
might
as
well
enjoi
it
.
the
biggest
merit
of
thi
film
is
also
the
most
interest
to
watch
.
the
confront
between
kevin
lomax
and
john
milton
ar
entertain
,
but
what
stand
out
amidst
thi
extrem
hatr
is
the
declin
of
the
wife
,
mari
ann
.
portrai
by
the
extrem
effect
charliz
theron
,
mari
ann
's
problem
ar
incred
intens
,
and
i
found
myself
want
to
wit
her
declin
.
thi
mai
sound
uncar
,
but
i
want
to
watch
becaus
i
felt
sorri
for
her
.
she
is
the
most
interest
charact
on
the
screen
,
who
is
forc
into
a
world
where
she
is
not
want
.
someth
the
devil
's
advoc
contain
actual
shock
me
for
reason
other
than
extrem
violenc
and
nuditi
,
especi
for
a
film
of
thi
natur
.
the
stori
actual
ha
someth
to
sai
about
human
.
in
on
of
the
last
scene
,
john
milton
explain
to
kevin
lomax
the
game
god
plai
with
hi
children
(
he
is
satan
,
of
cours
)
.
he
comment
that
it
is
human
natur
to
lust
and
loath
in
vaniti
.
then
,
god
set
up
rule
which
contradict
human
natur
.
thi
semi-religi
bash
is
more
humor
than
frighten
.
what
milton
sai
is
so
true
about
our
societi
that
i
found
myself
laugh
out
loud
,
partial
think
it
wa
funni
,
but
patial
realiz
it
wa
true
.
these
moral
dilemma
ar
present
throughout
the
devil
's
advoc
,
give
it
an
ad
depth
mani
film
skip
over
in
their
write
(
but
i
'm
sure
thei
came
straight
from
the
novel
it
wa
base
on
)
.
when
a
film
ha
someth
to
sai
about
our
societi
,
it
deserv
to
be
watch
.
the
cast
of
the
devil
's
advoc
is
on
of
the
highlight
,
as
we
see
memor
face
,
and
thei
put
spin
on
those

we
do
n't

would
rank

on

the
best

i

recommend
the

for
connoisseur
of
stage

fine

similarli
,
those
with
a
steep

in

on

the

sinc
three
quarter

in

the

the
most
amaz

about

how

thi
surpris

instead
i

the

mani

moment
to
push
it
along

some

why
not

thankfulli
,
we
alreadi
have

to
care
for

so
we
let
thi

slide

but
some
of
the
technic

ar
awkward
,
such
as
the

done

(
where
did

aspect
of

that

no

the

help
these

gener

the

,
their
ar

who
ar
try
to
put
togeth
a
scheme
to
creat
an

to

and
of

it
is
soon
reveal
that
anya
is
in
fact
the
lost
anastasia

dimitri
realiz
that
he
can
never
win
her
love
as
he
is
a
common
,
and
meanwhil
,
rasputin
is
not
dead
,
and
plot
hi
reveng
against
the
last
romanov
.
the
plot
is
actual
quit
well
structur
.
there
ar
a
lot
of
complex
that
mai
have
to
be
explain
to
the
kid
later
,
but
it
move
along
fast
enough
that
thei
'll
never
have
time
to
be
bore
.
what
thi
realli
mean
is
that
the
adult
wo
n't
be
bore
by
it
either
.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
banter
between
anya
and
dimitri
that
is
veri
funni
,
and
their
relationship
develop
quit
natur
as
the
film
progress
.
there
is
,
of
cours
,
lot
of
comedi
for
the
kid
,
includ
rasputin
's
pet
bat
,
bartok
(
hank
azaria
)
,
who
is
easili
the
funniest
thing
in
the
film
.
howev
,
the
comic
scene
never
distract
from
the
drama
,
but
ar
work
into
the
plot
almost
seamlessli
.
the
anim
is
gorgeou
-
the
charact
seem
to
come
to
life
through
the
talent
anim
.
not
sinc
beauti
&
the
beast
have
anim
charact
had
so
much
life
to
them
.
even
without
the
voic
,
thei
act
.
the
music
number
in
pari
is
a
show-stopper
,
with
some
of
the
background
render
in
an
impressionist
paint
style
.
as
with
all
recent
anim
featur
,
there
ar
song
,
howev
,
these
song
do
more
than
just
provid
fodder
for
top-40
singer
to
get
on
the
radio
(
although
there
ar
three
of
them
dure
the
end
credit
)
.
the
song
ar
all
veri
catchi
,
and
advanc
the
plot
,
instead
of
just
be
showpiec
(
except
for
the
pari
number
,
but
that
's
so
much
fun
,
it
's
okai
.
.
.
)
.
i
ca
n't
reccomend
anastasia
highli
enough
.
it
's
a
wonder
film
that
rank
right
up
there
with

it

come
up
with
a

unfortun

what
did
n't
linger
in

for

wa
the

even
wors
,
i
do
n't
find
myself

that
i
've

the
problem
,
i
think
,
li
not
with
the
cast
,
which
seem
to
be
try
veri
hard
for
the
materi
.
it
wa
the
script
that
could
n't
convinc
me
to
care
about
anyon
.
the
charact
were
put
out
all
kind
of
emot
,
but
i
found
no
reason
to
connect
with
ani
of
them
.
i
understood
that
the
stori
wa
about
cold
,
emotion
vacant
charact
,
but
for
me
to
care
about
them
,
i
have
to
identifi
with
them
somehow
and
want
them
to
inject
feel
into
their
live
.
jone
'
script
never
simpli
gave
me
that
opportun
.
in
the
end
,
it
almost
seem
as
if
campion
wa
try
to
inject
some
life
of
her
own
into
the
proceed
with
her
visual
flourish
.
unfortun
,
as
she
kept
paint
these
dazzl
pictur
,
thei
onli
serv
to
push
me
further
awai
from

materi
and
remind
me
that
there
wa
no

me
and
the
film
.
in

end
,
the

's
on

up
hurt
it

so
here
we
have
two

with

,
and
yet
i
wa
abl
to
truli
enjoi

why
?
with

you

much
to
my
surpris
,
van

continu
to
develop
as
a

.
hi
track

is
n't

as

he
's
a

of

thi

the

here
is
that
maximum

is
a
more
effect
hollywood
action
flick
than
either
hard

or
woo
's
subsequ
broken
arrow
.
here
's
the
rundown
.
van
damm
plai
a
french
cop
name
alain
moreau
who
is
shaken
when
a
policeman
friend
(
jean-hugu

find
a
corps
that
's
alain
's
exact
doubl

turn
out
alain
wa
separ
at
birth
from
hi
twin
brother
,
michael
,
who
ha
been
kill
by
some
russian
heavi
(
and
some
strang
american
look
cop
)
.
alain
doe
some
investig
.
he
find
that
michael
had
book
a
flight
to
new

citi
,
and
receiv
a
messag
from
someon
there
name
alex
bohemia

assum
michael

ident
,
alain
fli
to
new
york
and
get
tangl
up
with
michael
's
girlfriend
(
natasha
henstridg
)
,
the
fbi
,
and
the
russian
mob
in
littl
odessa
.
that
's
as
much
as
you
need
to
know
.
the
stori
is
adequ
,
but
not
overli
involv
--
and
the
major
plot
point
ar
basic
explain
to
you
twice
,
just
in
case
you
go
out
for
popcorn
at
the
wrong
moment
.
there
's
a
love
stori
,
too
,
but
i
did
n't
find
it
terribl
convinc
,
partli
becaus
ex-model
henstridg
is
too
high-strung
in
her
high-profil
debut
(
she
had
preciou
few
line
as
the
alien
ic
queen
in
speci
)
.
she
's
great
to
look
at
,
and
she
can
certainli
read
a
line
,
but
what
she
doe
here
ca
n't
realli
be
describ
as
``
act
.
``
of
cours
,
``
act
``
is
n't
realli
what
she
wa
hire
for
(
i
lost
track
of
whether
her
shirt
come
off
more
often
than
van
damm
's
)
.
the
movi
is
exception
violent
,
border
on
gratuiti
.
(
keep
that
in
mind
when
plan
your
date
.
)
the
stunt
ar
spectacular
,
and
the
fact
that
you
can
spot
van
damm
's
stand-in
make
hi
work
no
less
impress
.
there
's
onli
so
much
you
can
do
with
a
car

,
but
thi
movi
make
crisp

and
lam
ha
a
surpris
,
innov
sens
of
exactli
where
the
camera
should
go
to
catch
ani
bit
of
action
.
the
main
differ
between
lam
and
woo
,
i
believ
,
is
that
while

it
's

(
for
on

)
while
woo
's
hollywood
movi
look
like
the
work
of
a
talent
upstart
,
maximum
risk
is
a
surprisingli
confid
pictur
.
the
veri
first
shot
of
the
film
is
an
awkward
overhead
view
of
a
chase
through
the
street
of
a
european
citi
,

lam
's

the

is
a
particularli
savvi
complement
to
lam
's
shoot
style
,
accentu
rather
than
amplifi
the
action
.
the
perform
could
have
us
some
fine
tune
(
in

,
there
's
an
annoi

overwritten
manhattan
cab
driver
in
the
earli
scene
who
should
have
been

,
and
the
movi
doe
n't

of

the
stori
is
a
littl

ar

it

of

impress

beauti
shown
in

movi

onli
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
.
ad
on

of
thi
is
a
lesson
on
the
import
of
self-worth
.
kiki
initi
seem
to
deriv
much
of
her
self-worth
from
the
beauti
of
her
surround
and
the
peopl
around
her
,
but
an
encount
with
a
rude
girl
crash
down
her
bewonder
,
make
her
question
the
import
of
such
beauti
.
thi
caus
kiki
to
lose
faith

howev
,
kiki

to
realiz

the

of

but
the
innat
beauti
insid
her
.
see
kiki
regain
faith
in
herself
is
marvel
,
and
the
princip
devic
us
to
do
it
is
so
sublim
that
i
do
n't
even
want
to
hint
at
it
.
the
end
of
the
movi
ha
a
subtl
charm
combin
with
a
sens
of
aw
and
,
iron
,
the
most
disnei-esqu
moment
i
've
ever
seen
;
if
you
do
n't
hold
your
breath
in
wonder
you
might
want
to
get
medic
attent
.
the
movi
steer
free
of
mani
of
the
disnei
convent
:
there
is
no
violenc
,
howev
cartoonish
,
no
song-and-danc
number
,
and
kiki
's
pet
cat
jiji
is
more
a
friend
than
a
comed
sidekick
,
although
jiji
is
given
mani
funni
line
and
scene
.
howev
,
i
would
be
surpris
if
disnei
doe
n't
give
jiji
more
joke
,
or
at
least
the
voic
of
some
comedian
.
refreshingli
enough
,
the
moral
lesson
of
the

is
not
self-contradict

a
habit
disnei

have
gotten
into

anoth
differ
with

is
in
the
style
of

greater
attent
to

it
fit

thi

particularli
true
with

i

the

an

by

is
perhap
on
of
the
simplest
movi
i

also
on
of
the
funniest
.
in

it
is
thi

's
relianc
on
simplic
which
make
it
so
success
.
the
good
gui
and
the
bad
gui
ar
clear
,
the
humor
is
straightforward
,
and
the

is
as
uncompl

it
get
.
it
's
the
perfect
setup
for
a
relax
,
hilari
good
time
,
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
admit
it

i
like
the
fact
that
i
did
n't
have
to
think
all
that
much
while
watch
thi

i
just
sat
back

the
situat

we
've

against
the

big
busi

or
whatev

what
make
thi
film
differ
is
it
charact
.
darryl
think
he
's
got
the
best
life
in
the
world
-
he
tell
hi
famili
that
live
next
to
power
line
is
a
constant
remind
of
the
success
of
mankind
,
he
ask
who
would
ever
want
to
go
out
and
eat
in
a
fanci
restaur
when
he
's
got
the
meat
loaf
feast
prepar
by
hi
wife

and
he
swell
with
pride
when

the

about

that

with

the

still

i

let
me
assur
you
that
no

fulli
enjoi
thi

.
the
produc
ar
not
stupid
,
make
a
movi
just
for
fan
of
the

is
not
profit
.
you
have
to
reach
for
a
larger
audienc

therefor
,
the
movi
is
quit
user-friendli
.
altough
,
non-fan
will
onli
fail
to
understand
certain
emot
behind
the

but
fear
not
,
duchovni
and
anoth
man
later
on
provid
more
than
adequ

you
will
never
feel
as
if
you
just
walk
in
on
the
third
act
of
some
great
opera
.
in
ani
case
,
the
answer
is
no
.
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the

,
i
onli
watch
it
when
noth
els
is

i
prefer

i

watch

i
am
glad
to

everyth
you
need
to
know
is
explain
to
the

by

and
other
.
i
know
i
am
go
mayb
a
bit
too
far
to
make
my
point

everybodi
should
get

pleas
do
not

,
you
must
not

know
what
is

what
exactli
is
over
that
hill
and
what
that
weird
``
hummm
``
sound
is
all
about
.
you
have
been
warn
.
the
x-file
is
what
a
summer
should
be
.
excit
,
scari
,
great
special
effect
(
unlik
other
summer
movi
the
effect
do
not
take
over
the
movi
and
ar
onli
there
when
it
is
realli
necessari
)
and
good
perform
.
thi
is
come
from
a
gui
who
think
david
duchovni
is
the
human
equival
of
a
wooden
plank
.
from
start
to
finish
,
thi
movi
doe
not
let
go
of
you
.
when
i
compar
it
with
last
summer
's
movi
the
best
wai
to
describ
it
would
be
:
take
the
excit
and
great
score
from
face/off
and
the
deadli
us
of
sound
from
event
horizon
.
thi
flick
is
scari
,
not
in
a
b
movi
kind
of
wai
where
you
alwai
know
where
and
when
the
critter
will
jump
at
our
hero
.
in
fact
,
the
first
time
the
critter
in
thi
movi
make
an
apper
it
is
total
out
of
the
blue
.
you
might
as
well
bring
ear
plug
becaus
thi
thing
is
louuuudd
!
the
last
time
a
monster
scare
me
that
much
wa
when
i
first
saw
alien
as
a
six
year
old
kid
.
you
know
,
when
you
ar
affraid
to
put
your
feet
on
the
floor
becaus
the
creatur
might
be
under
the
chair
,
or
when
you
keep
try
to
cover
your
throat
with
your
shirt
?
so
yeah
,
the
x-file
is
scari
.
and
guess
what
?
you
never
even
have
to
see
the
monster
but
your
imagin
work
overtim
and
it
sure
beat
have
to
watch
a
flaw
,
comput
gener
,
babyzilla
,
it
look
like
you
could
walk
right
through
it
not
even
scarier
than
your
grandma
in
undi
type
of
monster
.
do
not
think
that
the
x-file
is
a
monster
movi
.
in
fact
,
the
creatur
is
there
for
mayb
three
minut
total
.
no
,
the
x-file
is
defin
a
mulder
episod
of
the
seri
.
sculli
is
at
hi
side
,
of
cours
,
but
gillian
anderson
get
mayb
half
the
screen
time
.
she
ha
a
coupl
of
good
scene
with
duchovni
,
but
she
get
kidnap
dure
the
last
half
hour
of
the
movi
so
she
doe
not
get
to
do
much
.
no
,
thi
is
mulder
's
time
in
the
spotlight
.
by
now
,
you
have
heard
of
the
scene
where
mulder
``
shower
``
independ
dai
.
if
you
have
not
then
i
will
not
spoil
it
for
you
,
let
's
just
sai
that
due
to
recent
event
mulder
should
be
``
shower
``
godzilla
instead
.
to
those
of
you
wonder
if
mulder
discov
that
the
truth
is
inde
out
there
.
.
.
who
care
!
?
if
he
did
find
it
the
seri
would
over
anywai
so
what
ar
you
complain
about
?
the
dialogu
in
interest
and
the
director
is
marvel
.
the
camera
is
almost
alwai
look
over
the
shoulder
of
our
hero
so
we
feel
as
if
we
ar
right
there
with
them
when
thei
open
a
door
or
climb
a
hill
.
the
script
is
spotless
,
everi
thing
that
happen
happen
for
a
purpos
.
if
you
ar
confus
by
someth
,
do
not
worri
becaus
it
will
all
becom
clear
later
on
but
,
and
i
can
not
stress
thi
enough
,
pai
attent
!
!
!
unlik
most
summer
movi
,
the
dialogu
is
twice
as
import
as
the
effect
.
miss
on
vital
piec
of
inform
and
,
like
most
peopl
who
talk
dure
movi
,
you
will
go
home
and
tell
all
your
friend
how
thi
movi
made
no
sens
.
also
,
to
those
peopl
who
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
dure
movi
.
.
.
do
n't
!
the
person
who
watch
the
movi
with
me
had
to
go
twice
and
twice
she
miss
an
import
convers
.
there
is
no
time
to
take
a
breather
between
scene
becaus
,
again
unlik
most
summer
movi
(
godzilla
anybodi
?
)
the
x-file
doe
not
need
to
fill
scene
between
the
suspens
and
the
action
with
useless
subplot
,
everi
scene
is
crucial
and
serv
a

.
who
need
to
see
the
blond
chiouaoua
have
a
``
big

so
far
thi
summer
i
have
seen
onli
on
movi
who
rank
higher
on
my
list
of
movi
i
'd
recommend
and
that
is
the
truman
show
but
it
onli
win
by
a
nose
.
but
the
truman
show
is
not
what
i
would
call
a
summer
movi
,
the
x-file
is
.
what
more
do
you
ask
from
a
summer
movi
other
than
the
chanc
to
be
excit
?
cool

?
it
's
got
some
.
puls

?
hell
ye
!
strang
enough
,
i
think
that
fan
of
the
seri
will
hate
thi
movi
while
non-fan
will
have
a
good
time
.
it
doe
not
provid

you

well
,
i

well
,
i
do
have
some
regret
,
but
that
is
not
the
point
in
the
previou

the
point
of
it

that
down
with

wa
a
film
that
,
from

,
did
not
entir
disappoint
me

sure
,
the
riski
us
of
vh
instead
of
super
8mm

16mm
wa
a
pain
,
and
the
natur
light
wa
on
of
the
most
annoi
thing
about

the
movi
itself
wa
fairli
enjoy

down
with
america
concern
a
govern
agent
,
needless
murder
,
and
a
book
contain
everyth
from
the
unabomb
's
manifesto
to
the
1995

like
the
previou
film
of

that
i
have
review
,
it
displai
an
off-kilter
humor
and
intellig
?
it
succe
in
make
me
laugh
where
countless
studio
film
fail
.
the
best
wai
to
see
thi
film
would
be
as
a
parodi
of
the
countless
conspiraci
film
that
we
have
been
drown
in
sinc
the
paranoia
of
the
80s
.
a
dy
movement
from
the
dai
thei
start
,
these
paranoid
`thriller
'
had
the
govern
alwai
cover
up
someth
and
had
the
same
favorit
word
:
`roswel
.
'
in
down
with
america
,
the
line
`roswel
'
is
highli
absent
.
with
an
about
ten
minut
run
time
,
down
with
america
effortlessli
sidestep
everi
clich
?
that
the
conspiraci
film
fell
into
,
make
joke
at
them
at
the
same
time
,
and
provid
us
with
funni
and
memor
charact
.
again
,
i
have
seen
movi
that
have
gone
on
two
hour
with
charact
i
could
n't
care
less
about
.
the
film
,
as
previous
state
,
concern
a
feder
agent
(
peter

,
an
obsess
librarian
(
meri

,
a

,
and
two
peopl
obsess
with
silenc
in
the

(

.
the
plot
:
a
book
contain
the
secret
of
all
anarchist
is
hidden
in
?
a
public
librari
where
it
can
be
view
by
all
.
from
there
we
go
into
a
delight
parodi
.
the
feder
agent
claim
hi
sovereign
right
to
alter
the
truth
,
the
librarian
goe
on
a
diatrib
about
the
sanctiti
of

.
we
spend
our
time
laugh
at
fairli
idiot
joke
that
ar
perform
much
too
well
consid
the
lack
of
coach
of
the
cast
.
although
the
actor
and
actress
ar
in
small
role
and
give
a
whole
new
mean
to
`no-name

,
it
end
up
be
the
no-name
peopl
who
do
a
good
job
,
deliv
better
perform
as
comic
villain
than
half
the
crap
that
hollywood
turn
out
.
for
onc
,
i
do
n't
have
a

that
i
know
offhand
to
give
you
as
to
where
to
locat
the

onlin

i
can
onli
sai
that
you
should
find
my
previou
review
of
l'auto
and
le
x-file
and
look
up
the
rigormorti
product
site
in
and
of
itself
.
it
's
almost
as
much
fun
as
the
film
.
here
is
a
film
that
is
so
unexpect
,
so
scari
,
and
so
origin
that
it
caught
me
off
guard
and
threw
me
for
a
loop
.
okai
,
it
is
n't
quit
origin
,
consid
it
is
a
sequel
to
the
box
offic
hit
speci
,
but
it
certainli
is
smart
.
most
film
of
thi
genr
ar
reminisc
of
those
cheesi
b-horror
film
from
the
50s
and
60s
,
and
some
even
becom
them
.
howev
,
as
we
learn
with
the
1995
small-budget
horror/sci-fi
film
,
sometim
expect
can
be
shatter
.
a
lot
of
critic
ha
gone
against
thi
film
(
from
what
i
have
read
so
far
,
anywai
--
yep
,
all
two
review
)
,
and
it
make
me
wonder
why
these
type
of
film
ar
automat
dismiss
as
gori
,
laughabl
piec
of
trash
.
but
,
the
thing
is
,
it
is
n't
.
it
's
well
made
,
well
act
,
and
quit
intellig
.
i
can
see
most
of
the
critic
now
complain
about
the
level
of
gore
or
the
level
of
sexual
in
the
film
.
but
the
speci
seri
is
n't
about
the
lack
of
these
element
.
it
's
about
how
much
it
can
get
into
on
film
.
and
yet
,
behind
it
all
,
it
ha
thi
basic
premis
that
allow
it
to
get
awai
with
do
so
.
speci
ii
begin
in
the

,
though
it
seem
to
be

creat
similar
timelin
as
our
realist
on

but
chang
it
to
fit

as
we

thi
is
becaus
the

the

howev

thi
time
around
,
most
of
her
``

urg
have
been
either
decreas
dramat

or
lie
dormant

the

is

and

involv
with
the

attack
,
she
want
to
learn
how
to
stop
the
alien
should
it
come
again
.
and
it
ha
.
stori-wise
,
speci
ii
is
much
stronger
than
it
predecessor
,
but
it
is
also
much
stronger
than
,
sai
,
alien
(
hei
,
i
love
the
film
,
but
you
ca
n't
tell
me
it
wa
strong
on
stori
)
.
what
surpris
me
the
most
with
thi
film
wa
the
incorpor
of
histor
fact
into
the
screenplai
.
in
my
search
for
extraterrestri
intellig
cours
in
colleg
,
we
learn
about
a
piec
of
rock
from
mar
which
land
in
on
of
the
pole
.
thi
piec
of
rock
contain
fossil
which
mai
have
been
proof
of
life
on
mar
(
later
,
it
wa
proven
that
it
wa
not
a
live
creatur
that
creat
it
)
.
the
script
us
thi
effect
,
but
also
manag
to
provid
a
well-balanc
plot
.
begin
with
the
first
man
on
mar
(
someth
i
have
alwai
dream
of
see
)
,
i
wa
hope
that
the
film
would
turn
thi
element
into
a
us
start
point
for
the
movi
.
and
it
doe
it
quit
well
.
the
charact
ar
all
smart
,
and
thei
know
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
.
the
onli
charact
that
seem
a
littl
clich
is
the
gener
(
georg
dzundza
)
,
and
yet
,
he
remain
logic
in
everyth
he
doe
.
there
ar
the
obviou
flaw
of
cours
,
mostli
ly
in
the
technic
aspect
.
the
special
effect
ar
onli
mediocr
,
and
some
ar
just
plain
bad
.
but
for
the
most
part
,
thei
remain
believ
(
i
even
notic
a
homag
to
the
alien
seri
when
the
mother
gave
birth
to
alien
children
)
.
also
,
the
most
realist
on
ar
usual
the
goriest
,
rang
from
peopl
be
torn
open
,
or
someon
's
head
be
blown
off
.
howev
,
some
plot
element
also
mai
elicit
laugh
from
the
audienc
,
includ
a
menag
a
troi
that
is
all
but
necessari
.
mani
peopl
dislik
the
speci
seri
becaus
all
it
is
is
an
excus
for
sex
,
nuditi
,
and
gori
violenc
.
howev
,
i
tend
to
disagre
.
what
were
the
alien
film
about
?
and
,
if
an
alien
speci
ever
did
come
to
earth
,
and
their
sole
purpos
wa
to
destroi
us
,
would
n't
you
mate
as
quickli
as
possibl
with
as
mani
peopl
as
possibl
?
my
onli
gripe
with
thi
is
dure
the
scene
where
patrick
goe
search
for
a
mate
in
a
groceri
store
.
i
did
n't
realiz
that
alien
were
that
picki
on
choos
women
to
mate
with
(
i
just
assum
it
is
hi
part-human
side
look
for
the
most
beauti
on
)
.
the
act
is
quit
good
for
thi
kind
of
film
.
it
is
a
vast
improv
over
the
first
film
,
at
least
.
the
act
is
the
kei
element
to
thi
film
:
if
it
wa
bad
,
it
would
have
lower
itself
into
camp
;
if
it
wa
good
,
it
would
have
ask
for
comparison
with
film
like
alien
.
okai
,
so
it
is
n't
that
good
.
georg
dzundza
is
probabl
the
most
obviou
mistak
on
cast
,
as
hi
over-the-top
imperson
of
a
gener
make
him
annoi
and
distract
.
natasha
henstridg
is
limit
thi
time
around
,
as
she
is
usual
enclos
in
a
cage
.
howev
,
she
doe
manag
a
veri
impress
perform
with
thi
aspect
hinder
ani
of
her
talent
.
oh
yeah
,
and
she
's
quit
fun
to
just
plain
watch
.
marg
helgenberg
is
immens
better
thi
time
around
,
and
her
perform
is
probabl
the
best
in
thi
film
.
michael
madsen
is
so-so
,
but
he
is
n't
annoi
,
and
he
soon
becom
rather
appeal
(
with
hi
nice
cynic
person
)
.
jame
cromwel
ha
a
small
part
,
but
he
make
it
much
better
than
what
it
could
have
been
with
a
more
incap
actor
.
as
i
sai
,
ani
film
with
jame
cromwel
dramat
increas
in
likeabl
.
mykelti
williamson
give
an
enjoy
perform
,
and
he
give
the
film
a
more
down-to-earth
feel
.
and
,
of
cours
,
justin
lazard
.
lazard
ha
so
far
been
ridicul
for
hi
perform
,
but
i
think
he
is
effect
.
sure
,
he
is
wooden
,
but
is
n't
that
what
hi
charact
is
like
?
the
moment
when
he
touch
the
glass
separ
henstridg
from
him
wa
extrem
well
done
,
due
to
the
coupl
's
act
.
speci
ii
is
rate
r
for
strong
sexual
,
sci-fi
violenc/gore
and
languag
.
thi
is
definit
an
r
rate
film
that
young
kid
should
not
see
.
more
than
like
,
thei
would
probabl
have
nightmar
and
never
have

what

i
almost
felt

over

earlier
in

movi
i
found
myself
wonder
if
it
would
be
better
for
truman
to
find
out
the
truth
or
whether
i
should
root
for
him
to
be
well
.
the
two
seem
exclus

on

,
but
weir
and
niccol
did
n't
see
it
that
wai

perhap
it
's
not
fair
to
critic
a
movi
for
what
it
is
n't
,
but
it
seem
like
there
were
some

the

there
's

in

i
would
